The entries are organized in three sections: the first dealing with the transitional period of fifteenth-century editions of medieval authorities, the second spanning the early modern period from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, and the third focusing on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The contributors are scholars from all over the world. Each old book is analyzed by a recognized specialist in the specific field of interest. Individual entries give a short biography of the author and discuss the significance of the works in the time and setting of their publication, and in their broader influence on the development of law worldwide. Introductory essays explore the development of Western legal traditions, especially the influence of the English common law, and of Roman and canon law on legal writers, and the borrowings and interaction between them. The book goes beyond the study of institutions and traditions of individual countries to chart a broader perspective on the transmission of legal concepts across legal, political, and geographical boundaries. Examining the branches of this genealogical tree of books makes clear their pervasive influence on modern legal systems, including attempts at rationalizing custom or creating new hybrid systems by transplanting Western legal concepts into other jurisdictions."},"tableOfContents":["Preface -- List of Contributors -- Table of Contents -- Chapter 1: General Introduction -- Chapter 2: Law Books during the Transition from Late-Medieval to Early-Modern Legal Scholarship -- 1.

It features revised papers that were presented at the Annual Conference of the European-American Consortium for Legal Education, held at the University of Parma, Italy, May 2014. This volume is organized in four sections, where the topic is mainly explored from a comparative perspective, and includes case studies. The first section covers theoretical issues. It offers an analysis of principles in shaping Dworkins theories about international law, a reflection on the role of procedural principles in defining the role of the judiciary, a view on the role of general principles in transnational judicial communication, a study on the recognition of international law from formal criteria to substantive principles, and an inquiry from the viewpoint of neo-constitutionalism. The second section contains studies on the role of general principles in selected legal systems, including International Law, European Union Law as well as Common Law systems. The third section features an analysis of select legal principles in a comparative perspective, with a particular focus on the comparison between European and American experiences. The fourth and last section explores selected principles in given areas of law, including the misuse of the lex specialis principle in the relationship between international human rights law and international humanitarian law, the role of the judiciary in Poland as regards discrimination for sexual orientation, and the impact of the ECtHR case law on Italian criminal law with regard to the principle of legality. Overall, the book offers readers a thoughtful reflection on how the interpretation, application, and development of general principles of law by the judiciary contribute to the evolution of legal systems at both the domestic and international levels as well as further their reciprocal interactions."},"tableOfContents":"Foreword; Mortimer N.S.

It contributes to the topical academic debate on family law exceptionalism by exploring the blurred lines between public law, private law and family law, and sheds light on the many shades of grey that exist. The contributions focus on both substantive and procedural family law on parents and children and on life partners, with particular attention for contractual arrangements of family formations and of conflict resolution. The hypothesis underlying all contributions was the trend towards contractualisation of family law. A convergent research outcome resulting from the comparison of national reports was the ambivalent position of family law in legal systems worldwide. That comparison shows that, whereas family law is clearly moving towards contract with regard to old family formations, the contrary is true for new family formations. The movement towards contract is rarely considered to be contractualisation pur sang, with civil effect. The movement towards status, finally, does not necessarily witness family law exceptionalism vis--vis private law, in view of the increasing State interventionism in private law relations in general. In sum, as the volume shows, the high permeability of the demarcations between the State, the family and the market impedes a categorial approach. This volume is based on the general and selected national reports on the topic Contractualisation of Family Law that were presented at the XIXth International Congress of Comparative Law in Vienna in July 2014."},"tableOfContents":"About the Authors -- 1.

Within the framework of different important areas of EU law, such as the internal market, consumer protection law, social law, investment law, environment law, migration law, legal translation and terminology, it examines the Unions approach to the regulation and management of legal risks. Over the years, the Union has come to a point where it is becoming increasingly difficult to justify its authority to regulate in various areas of law. In managing legal risks deriving from the diversity of Member States laws, which create barriers to trade and hinder the Unions economy, the Union itself has actually produced new legal risks that now have to be addressed. This failure on the part of EU institutions to manage legal risks has contributed to legal uncertainty for actors operating on the internal market. This book intends to contribute to the Unions smoother functioning and continuing development by proposing effective concrete solutions for managing the legal risks distorting the development of various areas of EU law. It pursues an innovative and effective approach to identify legal risks, their causes at the EU level and their impacts on the functioning of the Union and its Member States. By presenting new approaches in this context, the first book on legal risk management in the EU will actively promote the improvement of the EU lawmaking process and the application of EU law in practice."},"tableOfContents":"Part I - Legal Risks in Developement of EU Law: Reframing Legal Risk in EU Law by Aurlien Raccah -- Legal Risks in the Relation between National Constitutional Law and EU Law by Darinka Piqani -- Human Rights Advocacy for an International Society of Risk by Ioannis K.

The final section explores the role of custom in international law from a variety of legal and economic perspectives.

There is a need to adopt a transdisciplinary approach to multifunctional agriculture in order to integrate the agroecological paradigm in legal regulation. This does not require a super-law that hierarchically purports to incorporate and supplant the existing legal fields; rather, it calls for the creation of a trans-law that progressively works to coordinate interlegalities between different legal fields, respecting their autonomy but emphasizing their common historical roots in rus in the process. Rus, the rural phenomenon as a whole, reflects the plurality and interdependence of different complex systems based jointly on the land as a central point of reference. Rural is more than agricultural: if agriculture is understood traditionally as an activity aimed at exploiting the land for the production of material goods for use, consumption and private exchange, rurality marks the reintegration of agriculture into a broader sphere, one that is not only economic, but also social and cultural; not only material, but also ideal, relational, historical, and symbolic; and not only private, but also public. In approaching rus, the natural and social sciences first became specialized, multiplied, and compartmentalized in a plurality of first-order disciplines; later, they began a process of integration into Agroecology as a second-order, multi-perspective and shared research platform. Today, Agroecology is a transdiscipline that integrates other fields of knowledge into the concept of agroecosystems viewed as socio-ecological systems. However, the law seems to still be stuck in the first stage. Following a reductionist approach, law has deconstructed and shattered the universe of rus into countless, disjointed legal elementary particles, multiplying the planes of analysis and, in particular, keeping Agricultural Law and Environmental Law two separate fields. ."},"tableOfContents":"Part I: Law and Agroecology: Crossing the Boundaries Between Natural, Social and Legal Sciences: 1.

This book collects over 50 discrete law reform recommendations, encapsulated in short, digestible essays written by leading Australian scholars. It emerges from a major conference held at The Australian National University in 2016, which featured intensive discussion among participants from government, practice and the academy. The book is intended to serve as a national focal point for Australian legal innovation. It is divided into six main parts: commercial and corporate law, criminal law and evidence, environmental law, private law, public law, and legal practice and legal education. In addition, Indigenous perspectives on law reform are embedded throughout each part. This collective work--the first of its kind--will be of value to policy makers, media, law reform agencies, academics, practitioners and the judiciary. It provides a bird's eye view of the current state and the future of law reform in Australia."},"tableOfContents":["Foreword / The Hon Michael Kirby AC CMG -- Introduction / Ron Levy, Molly O'Brien, Simon Rice, Pauline Ridge and Margaret Thornton -- Keynote: Reforming Law - The Role of Theory / Margaret Davies -- Part I.

It explains that aboriginal customary law can be a source of common law title to land in former British colonies, whether they were acquired by settlement or by conquest or cession from another colonising power. The doctrine of Common Law Aboriginal Customary Title provides a coherent approach to the source, content, proof and protection of Aboriginal land rights which overcomes problems arising from the law as currently understood and leads to more just results. The doctrine's applicability in Australia, Canada and South Africa is specifically demonstrated. While the jurisprudential underpinnings for the doctrine are consistent with fundamental common law principles, the author explains that the Australian High Court's decision in Mabo provides a broader basis for the doctrine: a broader basis which is consistent with a re-evaluation of case-law from former British colonies in Africa, as well as from the United States, New Zealand and Canada. In this context, the book proffers a reconceptualisation of the Crown's title to land in former colonies and a reassessment of conventional doctrines, including the doctrine of tenure and the doctrine of continuity."},"tableOfContents":["pt.

These essays, each written in the official language chosen by the authors, provide a critical perspective on Canada's past and present in international law, survey the challenges that lie before us and offer renewed focus for Canada's pursuit of global justice and the rule of law. Part I explores the history and practice of international law, including sources of international law, Indigenous treaties, international treaty diplomacy, domestic reception of international law and Parliament's role in international law. Part II explores Canada's role in international law, governance and innovation in the broad fields of international economic, environmental and intellectual property law. Economic law topics include international trade and investment, dispute settlement, subnational treaty making, international taxation and private international law. Environmental law topics include the international climate change regime and international treaties on chemicals and waste, transboundary water governance and the law of the sea. Intellectual property law topics explore the development of international IP protection and the integration of IP law into the body of international trade law. Part III explores Canadian perspectives on developments in international human rights and humanitarian law, including judicial implementation of these obligations, international labour law, business and human rights, international criminal law, war crimes, child soldiers and gender.\"--"},"tableOfContents":"Foreword / L.

The broad premise of [this book] is that the 'artificial reason' of law was a complex art form that shared the same rhetorical strategy as the plays of Shakespeare. Common law and Shakespearean drama of this period employed various aesthetic devices to capture the imagination and the emotional attachment of their respective audiences. Common law of the Jacobean era, as spoken in the law courts, learnt at the Inns of Court and recorded in the law reports, used imagery that would have been familiar to audiences of Shakespeare's plays. In its juridical form, English law was intrinsically dramatic, its adversarial mode of expression being founded on an agonistic model. Conversely, Shakespeare borrowed from the common law some of its most critical themes: justice, legitimacy, sovereignty, community, fairness, and (above all else) humanity. Each chapter investigates a particular aspect of the common law, seen through the lens of a specific play by Shakespeare. Topics include the unprecedented significance of rhetorical skills to the practice and learning of common law (Love's Labour's Lost); the early modern treason trial as exemplar of the theatre of law (Macbeth); the art of law as the legitimate distillation of the law of nature (The Winter's Tale); the efforts of common lawyers to create an image of nationhood from both classical and Judeo-Christian mythography (Cymbeline); and the theatrical device of the island as microcosm of the Jacobean state and the project of imperial expansion (The Tempest).\" -- Page i."},"tableOfContents":"Machine generated contents note: 1. `Fie, painted rhetoric!'

It offers a forum for the publication of scholarly articles of a more general nature in the area of public international law including the law of the european Union.  One of the key functions or purposes of international law (and law in general for that matter) is to provide long-term stability and legal certainty. Yet, international legal rules may also function as tools to deal with non-permanent or constantly changing issues, and rather than stable, international law may have to be flexible or adaptive. Prima facie, one could think of two main types of temporary aspects relevant from the perspective of international law. First, the nature of the object addressed by international law or the problem that international law aims to address may be inherently temporary (temporary objects). Second, a subject of international law may be created for a specific period of time, after the elapse of which this entity ceases to exist (temporary subjects). These types of temporariness raise several questions from the perspective of international law, which are hardly addressed from a more conceptual perspective. This volume of the Netherlands Yearbook of International Law aims to do exactly that by asking the question of how international law reacts to various types of temporary issues. Put differently, where does international law stand on the continuum of predictability and pragmatism when it comes to temporary issues or institutions?"},"tableOfContents":"Between Pragmatism and Predictability: Temporariness International Law.-Temporariness and Change in Global Governance.-Temporary International Legal Regimes as Frames for Permanent Ones.-The International Rule of Law Time after Time: Temporary Institutions between Change and Continuity -- International Law and Time: A Reflection of the Temporal Attitudes of International Lawyers through Three Paradigms.-(Inter)Temporal Considerations in the Interpretative Process of the VCLT: Do Treaties Endure, Perdure or Exdure? -- Shifting Demands In International Institutional Law: Securing The United Nations Accountability For The Haitian Cholera Outbreak -- Protecting Human Rights During Emergencies: Delegation, Derogation and Deference.-Temporary Protection: Hovering at the Edges of Refugee Law -- Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea: Enhancing Flexibility in International Climate Change Law.-Commissions of Inquiry: Flexible Temporariness or Permanent Predictability?.-Special Temporary Measures and the Norm of Equality -- Paradise Postponed?

The book starts with a general analysis of the issue, offering general conclusions about the experiences in different countries. It then analyses the aforementioned themes from the perspective of the domestic law of different European nations and a number of international organisations (European Union, MERCOSUR, and Andean Community). In addition, the book studies the role of the European Union in the progress towards the recognition and execution of foreign administrative acts, where the principle of mutual recognition plays a vital part. Finally, the book analyses the international conventions on the recognition and execution of administrative acts and on the legalisation of public documents."},"tableOfContents":"I.

It provides an historic understanding of how and why after 5,000 years of water governance, that governance still has not reached stability. It identifies the key research questions for water law and policy while providing an overview of the current global water governance regime, its evolving characteristics, and the legal theories involved in these changes. It focuses on water law and discusses the characteristics of national, supranational, and international water law through a combination of case studies and thematic chapters. The Evolution of the Law and Politics of Water is the first volume to take a global perspective on the evolution of water law and policy. It describes global patterns and sets forth the particulars of eight national legal systems drawn from every continent and five regional or supranational systems, as well as the body of customary international law as a whole. In particular, it is the first book to explore the interrelation between culture, religion, government and law in water governance and management. The volume is, therefore, a must-read for anyone interested in how water governance has changed through time and in different places as well as anyone interested in how water law has sought to channel water governance through time and in different places and what variables account for the relative success (or lack of success) of water law in performing this channelling function. It is suggestive of possible lines of water law reform and whether a particular reform is likely to be successful."},"tableOfContents":"Part 1. Introduction. 1. The Evolution of Global Water Law. 2.

Building upon previous analyses which have focused on a single aspect of extraterritorially, this book examines the fields of Criminal and Human Rights law as the two main areas of non-private law which are frequently applied across borders. Both fields are placed in context before being drawn together in a coherent and systematic way. The book examines recent law and practice, as well as historic developments and explores the concept of enforcement. The author's analysis includes coverage of topics such as the criminalisation of sex-tourism, the extradition of white-collar criminals and the application of human rights law to Iraq following American and British intervention in the region. Law Across Borders goes on to point the way forward in the development of the extraterritorial application of public law, and suggests ways in which greater coherence can be achieved. This book will be of particular interest to practitioners, academics and scholars of International Law, Human Rights Law and Criminal Law. It is unique in its ambition to offer a comprehensive description and analysis of the extra-territorial application of UK Human Rights Law and Criminal Law in a single text\"--"}],"tableOfContents":"Introduction -- The context -- United Kingdom criminal law across borders -- United Kingdom human rights law across borders -- Synthesis : extra-legal context, criticisms, themes and conclusion.","note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"Paul Arnell."},{"@type":"bibliography","#text":"Includes bibliographical references and index."}],"subject":[{"geographicCode":{"@authority":"marcgac","#text":"e-uk---"}},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Exterritoriality"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Conflict of laws","Jurisdiction"],"geographic":"Great Britain"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Criminal law","geographic":"Great Britain"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Human rights","geographic":"Great Britain"}],"classification":[{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"KD680 .A97 2012"},{"@edition":"23","@authority":"ddc","#text":"340.90941"},{"@authority":"bisacsh","#text":"LAW000000 LAW016000 LAW051000"}],"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"9780415558617 (hbk. : alk. paper)"},{"@type":"isbn","#text":"0415558611 (hbk. : alk. paper)"},{"@type":"isbn","#text":"9780203153345 (ebk.)"},{"@type":"isbn","#text":"0203153340 (ebk.)"},{"@type":"lccn","#text":"^^2011023211"},{"@type":"oclc","#text":"495781663"}],"recordInfo":{"descriptionStandard":"aacr","recordContentSource":{"@authority":"marcorg","#text":"DLC"},"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"110531"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20120330"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"990131481210203941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)"},"relatedItem":{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/990131481210203941/catalog"}},"location":[{"physicalLocation":{"@valueURI":"http://isni.org/isni/000000011940971X","@displayLabel":"Harvard repository","@type":"repository","#text":"Harvard Law School Library, Harvard University"},"shelfLocator":"KD680 .A97 2012"},"null"],"extension":{"librarycloud":{"HarvardRepositories":{"HarvardRepository":"Law School"},"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc.prod/990131481210203941","priorrecordids":{"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALEPH","#text":"013148121"}},"processingDate":"2019-01-19T07:10Z"}}},{"titleInfo":[{"nonSort":"The  ","title":"law in the Scriptures","subTitle":"with explanations of the law terms and legal references in both the Old and the New Testaments"},{"@type":"alternative","@displayLabel":"On spine:","title":"Genesis to Revelation"}],"name":{"@type":"personal","namePart":["White, Edward J.

Given the drastic changes in the two jurisdictions in recent decades, the book covers not only the current law, but also how these laws evolved into their current forms. Moreover, this book not restates black-letter laws, but also offers economic analysis of the driving force behind the legal evolution and examines whether the legal changes are economically efficient. Given China's dazzling economic development in the past three decades, few would question the importance of studying China, particularly the four basic legal fields that will shape the future of the Chinese regime and greatly affect the interest of foreign investors. Why Taiwan? To put China's legal changes in context, one has to find a proper benchmark. Hong Kong and Singapore are ruled by Chinese people, but their laws are fundamentally shaped by English common law, and they are both much smaller than Taiwan. Macao is in a similar situation, except that it has imported Portuguese law, which has hardly any influence on laws in China. By contrast, in the property, contract, and tort laws of China and Taiwan, the doctrinal structures are both civil-law, whereas in business organization law, the U.S. law is the main inspiration. Moreover, in many ways, private laws in China and Taiwan are heavily influenced by German jurisprudence, making the comparison even more meaningful. There is also strong evidence that Chinese scholars and legislature, in formulating these four areas of laws, widely consult laws and legal scholarship in Taiwan\"--"},"tableOfContents":"Concentrated

applications of Behavioural Law and Economics in European legal culture. By the same token, it fosters the dialogue between European and American Law and Economics scholars. The traditional neo-classical microeconomic theory explains human behaviour by using Rational Choice. According to this model, people tend to maximize the difference between expected utility and cost (expected utility theory). This theory includes three assumptions: (1) unbounded rationality, (2) unbounded self-interest, and (3) unbounded willpower. Behavioural Economics questions these assumptions and endeavours to render economic analysis more realistic by underpinning it with psychological insights. In recent years, the influence of Behavioural Economics on the Economic Analysis of Law has gained momentum. Behavioural Law and Economics generates a better theoretical understanding of legal phenomena and offers a multitude of applications in legislation and legal adjudication. This volume is testament to the growing and thriving Law and Economics movement in Europe. The European Law and Economics community has steadily grown and the yearly Law and Economics Conference at the law faculty of the University of Lucerne has successfully become a guiding star in the vast sky of Law and Economics."},"tableOfContents":"Foreword; Sebastian Heselhaus -- Preface; Klaus Mathis -- Introduction; Klaus Mathis -- About the Authors.-Part I: Foundations.-1 European and American Perspectives on Behavioral Law and Economics; Thomas Ulen -- 2The Next Generation of Behavioural Law and Economics; Avishalom Tor -- 3From Rational Choice to Behavioural Economics; Klaus Mathis and Ariel David Steffen.-Part II: Applications.-4Why Do We Need Responsive Regulation and Behavioural Research in EU Internal MarketLaw?; Kai Purnhagen.-5 Can EU Consumer Law Benefit from Behavioural Insights?; Anne-Lise Sibony.-6Buttons, Boxes, Ticks, and Trust; Martin Engel and Johanna Stark.-7Loss Aversion, Omission Bias and the Civil Standard of Proof; Mark Schweizer.-8 How Role and Framing Influence Litigants Perception of Civil Procedure; Edgar Klinger and Gnter Bierbrauer.-9 Investment SuitabilityRequirements in the Light of Behavioural Findings; Rainer Baisch and Rolf H.

Written by accredited specialists in criminal law, constitutional law, international public law, and the philosophy of law, the majority of them ex-Counsels of the Spanish Constitutional Court, it addresses various manifestations of the principle of legality: the requirement of precision, the judicial subjection to law and the prohibition of bis in idem. It does so not only from a theoretical perspective, but also through a comparative study of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the Court of Justice of the European Union and state constitutional courts. This practical approach characterizes the book, which culminates in a detailed analysis of the relevant ECtHR Judgement Del Ro Prada v. Spain on the retroactivity of unfavourable jurisprudence. \"Multilevel protection of the principle of legality in Criminal Law\" is a useful instrument of reflection for scholars of both the principle of criminal legality and the problems that arise from the concurrency of protective jurisdictions of human rights."},"tableOfContents":"Part I Multilevel Protection of Fundamental Rights -- Part II Multilevel Protection of the Principle of Legality in Criminal Law -- Part III Parot Doctrine.","note":{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"edited by Mercedes Prez Manzano, Juan Antonio Lascuran Snchez, Marina Mnguez Rosique."},"subject":[{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Criminal law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Conflict of laws"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Conflict of laws"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"International law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Comparative law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Constitutional law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Human rights"},{"topic":"Law"},{"topic":"Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law"},{"topic":"Constitutional Law"},{"topic":"Criminal Law"},{"topic":"Sources and Subjects of International Law, International Organizations"},{"topic":"Human Rights"}],"classification":[{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"K7000-7720.22"},{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"K7073-7078"},{"@edition":"23","@authority":"ddc","#text":"340.9"},{"@edition":"23","@authority":"ddc","#text":"340.2"}],"relatedItem":["null",{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/99153672057903941/catalog"}}],"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"3-319-63865-3"},{"@type":"doi","#text":"10.1007/978-3-319-63865-2"}],"recordInfo":{"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"171026"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20171026"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"99153672057903941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)"},"location":[{"physicalLocation":{"@valueURI":"http://isni.org/isni/000000011940971X","@displayLabel":"Harvard repository","@type":"repository","#text":"Harvard Law School Library, Harvard University"},"shelfLocator":"K5018 .M85 2018"},"null"],"extension":{"librarycloud":{"HarvardRepositories":{"HarvardRepository":"Law School"},"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc.prod/99153672057903941","processingDate":"2018-11-30T18:40Z"}}},{"titleInfo":{"title":"Rational suicide, irrational laws","subTitle":"examining current approaches to suicide in policy and law"},"name":{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Stefan, Susan","role":[{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"creator"}},{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"author."}}]},"typeOfResource":"text","genre":[{"@authority":"marcgt","#text":"bibliography"},{"@authority":"rdacontent","#text":"text"}],"originInfo":[{"place":{"placeTerm":[{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"code","#text":"nyu"},{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"text","#text":"New York (State)"}]},"dateIssued":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"2016"},"copyrightDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"2016"},"edition":"First Edition.","issuance":"monographic"},{"place":{"placeTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"New York, NY :"}},"publisher":"Oxford University Press,","dateIssued":"2016."}],"language":{"languageTerm":[{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"},{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"text","#text":"English"}]},"physicalDescription":{"form":[{"@authority":"marcform","#text":"print"},{"@type":"media","@authority":"rdamedia","#text":"unmediated"},{"@type":"carrier","@authority":"rdacarrier","#text":"volume"}],"extent":"xxvi, 552 pages ; 24 cm."},"abstract":[{"@type":"Summary","#text":"\"When should we try to prevent suicide? Should it be facilitated for some people, in some circumstances? For the last forty years, law and policy on suicide have followed two separate and distinct tracks: laws aimed at preventing suicide and, increasingly, laws aimed at facilitating it. In Rational Suicide, Irrational Laws legal scholar Susan Stefan argues that these laws co-exist because they are based on two radically disparate conceptions of the would-be suicide. This is the first book that unifies policies and laws, including constitutional law, criminal law, malpractice law, and civil commitment law, toward people who want to end their lives. Based on the author's expert understanding of mental health and legal systems, analysis of related national and international laws and policy, and surveys and interviews with more than 300 suicide-attempt survivors, doctors, lawyers, and mental health professionals, Rational Suicide, Irrational Laws exposes the counterproductive nature of current policies and laws about suicide. Stefan proposes and defends specific reforms, including increased protection of mental health professionals from liability, increased protection of suicidal people from coercive interventions, reframing medical involvement in assisted suicide, and focusing on approaches to suicidal people that help them rather than assuming suicidality is always a symptom of mental illness. Stefan compares policies and laws in different states in the U.S. and examines the policies and laws of other countries in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, including the 2015 legalization of assisted suicide in Canada. The book includes model statutes, seven in-depth studies of people whose cases presented profound ethical, legal, and policy dilemmas, and over a thousand cases interpreting rights and responsibilities relating to suicide, especially in the area of psychiatric malpractice\"--"},{"@type":"Summary","#text":"\"Rational Suicide, Irrational Laws argues that laws aimed at preventing suicide and laws aimed at facilitating it co-exist because they are based on two radically disparate conceptions of the would-be suicide.

"},"abstract":{"@type":"Summary","#text":"This book explains, compares and assesses the legal implications of Dieselgate within a range of selected jurisdictions and at the EU, international and comparative law level. The book analyses the US EPA-VW 14.7-billion-dollar settlement of 2016, one of the largest civil settlements in the history of environmental law. As it shows, the Dieselgate affair has raised a host of issues concerning corporate and social responsibility, tort liability, environmental liability, contractual defective products, warranty, and false environmental claims in a range of jurisdictions. Issues like repurchasing or retrofitting cars from consumers and making direct payments to consumers through car buy-backs and compensation are analysed. Further, the book relates how Dieselgate has also contributed to the discussion about the introduction of more effective collective measures of redress for consumers, such as class actions, in Germany, France, Italy and the UK. The book subsequently reviews the criminal offences Volkswagen is currently confronted with in Germany, France and Italy, i.e. fraud and manipulation of capital markets (by belatedly providing shareholders with essential information relevant for the share value), and, potentially, environmental crimes. It demonstrates how Dieselgate has sparked new debates in Germany, Italy, France and the UK about the need to introduce enterprise liability for organised crimes, lack of compliance and control structures, and intentional violations of the law. Lastly, the book discusses how EU law has sought to respond to Dieselgate and thus investigates the controversial EU Regulation No. 2016/646 introducing a \"temporary conformity factor\" of 2.1 (equivalent to a 110% increase on the current limit) to be applied for NOx in the new RDE testing cycle, and the works of the EU committee of inquiry into Emissions Measurements in the Automotive Sector (EMIS)."},"tableOfContents":"Introduction by Marco Frigessi di Rattalma -- Part I National Perspectives: France by Laurent Posocco -- Germany by Christoph U.

Anti-corruption is one of the preeminent issues in the modern global commercial order, and is tackled with the help of criminal law and contract law in different ways in different countries. The reports included in this volume, from very diverse parts of the world, represent a unique and rich compilation of court decisions, doctrinal discussions and a pool of suggested solutions. The central theme is the enforceability of three problematic types of contracts: the bribe agreement, whereby a bribe payer promises the agent of his business partner a personal benefit in exchange for favourable contract terms; the agreement between a bribe payer and an intermediary (a bribe merchant), where the latter offers his expertise to help funnel bribes to agents of the business partner; and, finally, the contract between the bribe payer and his business partner which was obtained by means of bribery. The analysis is tailored toward commercial contracts, which can also include contracts with state-owned enterprises. The examination and comparison of international and national initiatives included in this volume advance the discussion on the most appropriate remedies in corruption cases, and show how to get past the boundaries of criminal, private and contract law."},"tableOfContents":"Preface -- About the Authors -- I.

It examines the differences and similarities between the Supreme Peoples Court of Mainland China and those that follow Western models. It also offers a comparative study of a selection of supreme courts in Europe and Latin America. The contributors argue that the Supreme Courts should give guidance to the development of the law and provide legal unity. For China, the Chinese author argues, that therefore there should be more emphasis on the procedure for reopening cases. The chapters on Western-style supreme courts argue that there should be adequate access filters; the procedure of reopening cases is considered to be problematic from the perspective of the finality of the administration of justice. In addition, the authors discuss measures that allow supreme courts in both regions to deal with their existing caseload, to reduce this caseload, and to avoid divergences in the case law of the supreme court. This volume offers ideas that will help supreme courts in both the East and the West to remove unmanageable caseloads. As a result, these courts will be better able to assist in the interpretation and clarification of the law, to provide for legal unity, and to give guidance to the development of the law. ."},"tableOfContents":"Chapter 1.

By applying a multi-disciplinary approach that combines consumers psychology and sellers drafting power in the logic of efficiency and good faith, the book provides a fresh and unconventional analysis of the existing literature, both theoretical and empirical. Moving from the unconscionability doctrine, it criticizes (and in some cases refutes) its main conclusions based on criteria which are usually invoked to sustain the need for public intervention to protect consumers, and specifically related to Law (contract complexity), Psychology (consumer lack of sophistication criterion) and Economics (market structure criterion). It also analyzes the effects of different regulations, such as banning vexatious clauses or mandating disclosure clauses, showing that none of them protect consumers, but in fact prove to be harmful when consumers are more vulnerable, that is whenever sellers can exploit some degree of market power. In closing, the book combines these disparate aspects, arguing that the solution (if any) to the problem of consumer exploitation and market inefficiency associated with the use of contracts of adhesion in these contexts cannot be found in removing or prohibiting hidden clauses, but instead has to take into account the effects of these clauses on the contract as a whole."},"tableOfContents":"1.

Shah identifies grey areas in the Islamic law of qital and argues for their expansion and clarification. Shah also calls for new rules to be developed to cover what he calls the blind spots in the Islamic law of qital. He shows how Islamic law and the law of armed conflict could contribute to each other in certain areas, such as, the law of occupation; air and naval warfare; and the use of modern weaponry. Such a contribution is neither prohibited by Islamic law nor by international law. Shah applies the Islamic law of qital and the law of armed conflict to a live armed conflict in Pakistan and argues that all parties, the Taliban, the security forces of Pakistan and the American CIA, have violated one or more of the applicable laws. He maintains that whilst militancy is a genuine problem, fighting militants does not allow or condone violation of the law.

Dominion : Of the causes and first beginning of civil government : That the laws of nature are not sufficient to preserve peace ; That the laws of nature, in the state of nature, are silent ; That the security of living according to the laws of nature consists in the concord of many persons ; That the concord of many persons is not constant enough for a lasting peace ; The reason why the government of certain brute creatures stands firm in concord only, and why not of men ; That not only consent, but union also, is required to establish the peace of mean ; What union is ; In union, the right of all men is conveyed to one ; What civil society is ; What a civil person is ; What it is to have the supreme power, and what to be a subject ; Two kinds of cities, natural and by institution --^","Of the right of him, whether council or one man only, who hath the supreme power in the city : There can no right be attributed to a multitude out of civil society, nor any action to which they have not under seal consented ; The right of the greater number consenting, is the beginning of a city ; That every man retains a right to protect himself according to his own free will, so long as there is no sufficient regard had to his security ; That a coercive power is necessary to secure us ; What the sword of justice is ; That the sword of justice belongs to him who hath the chief command ; That the sword of war belongs to him also ; All judicature belongs to him too ; The legislative power is his only ; The naming of magistrates and other officers of the city belongs to him ; Also the examination of all doctrines ; Whatsoever he doth is unpunishable ; That the command his citizens have granted is absolute,^","and what proportion of obedience is due to him ; That the laws of the city bind him not ; That no man can challenge a propriety to anything against his will ; By the laws of the city only we come to know what theft, murder, adultery, and injury is ; The opinion of those who would constitute a city, where there should not be any one endued with an absolute power ; The marks of supreme authority ; If a city be compared with a man, he that hath the supreme power is in order to the city, as the human soul is in relation to the man ; That the supreme command cannot by right be dissolved through their consents by whose compacts it was first constituted --^","Of the three kinds of government: democracy, aristocracy, monarchy : That there are three kinds of government only: democracy, aristocracy, monarchy ; That oligarchy is not a diverse form of government distinct from aristocracy, nor anarchy any form at all ; That a tyranny is not a diverse state from a legitimate monarchy ; That there cannot be a mixed state, fashioned except there be certain times and places of meeting prefixed, is dissolved ; In a democracy, the intervals of the times of meeting must be short, or the administration of government during the interval committed to some one ; In a democracy, particulars contrast with particulars to obey the people; the people is obliged to no man ; By what acts aristocracy is constituted ; In an aristocracy the nobles make no compact,^","neither are they obliged to any citizen or to the whole people ; The nobles must necessarily have their set meetings ; By what acts monarchy is constituted ; Monarchy is by compact obliged to none for the authority it hath received ; Monarchy is ever in the readiest capacity to exercise all those acts which are requisite to good government ; What king on sin that is, and what sort of men are guilty of it, when the city performs not its office towards citizens, nor the citizens towards the city ; A monarch made without limitation of time hath power to elect his successor ; Of limited monarchs ; A monarch, retaining his right of government, cannot by any promise whatsoever be connecessary to the exercise of his authority ; How a citizen is freed from subjection","Of the rights of lords over their servants : What lord and servant signify ; The distinction of servants, into such as upon trust enjoy their natural liberty. or slaves and such as serve being imprisoned or bound in fetters ; The obligation of a servant arises from the liberty of body allowed him by his lord ; Servants that are bound are not by any compacts tied to their lords ; The lord may sell his servant, or alienate him by testament ; The lord cannot injure his servant ; He that is lord of the lord is lord also of his servants ; By what means servants are freed ; Dominion over beasts belongs to the rights of nature --^","Of the right of parents over their children, and of hereditary government : Paternal dominion ariseth not from generation ; Dominion over infants belongs to him or her who first hath them in their power ; Dominion over infants is originally the mother's ; The exposed infant is his from whom he receives his preservation ; The child that hath one parent a subject and the other a sovereign, belongs to him or her in authority ; In such conjunction of man and woman as neither hath command over the other, the children are the mother's, unless by compact or civil law it be otherwise determined ; Children are no less subject to their parents than servants to their lords and subjects to their princes ; Of the honor of parents and lords ; Wherein liberty consists,^","and the difference of subjects and servants ; There is the same right over subjects in an hereditary government which there is in an institutive government ; The question concerning the right of succession belongs only to monarchy ; A monarch may by his will and testament dispose of his supreme authority ; Or give it, or sell it ; A monarch dying without testament is ever supposed to will that a monarch should succeed him ; And some one of his children ; And a male rather than female ; And the eldest rather than the younger ; And his brother, if he want issue, before all others ; In the same manner that men succeed to the power, do they also succeed to the right of succession --^","A comparison between three kinds of government, according to their several inconveniences : A comparison of the natural state with the civil ; The conveniences and inconveniences of the ruler and his subjects are alike ; The praise of monarchy ; The government under one cannot be said to be unreasonable in this respect, namely, because one hath more power than all the rest ; A rejection of their opinion who say that a lord with his servants cannot make a city ; Exactions are more grievous under a popular state than a monarchy ; Innocent subjects are less exposed to penalties under a monarch than under the people ; The liberty of single subjects is not less under a monarch than under a people ; It is no disadvantage to the subjects, that they are not all admitted to public deliberations ; Civil deliberations are unadvisedly committed to great assemblies,^","by reason of the unskillfulness of the most part of men ; In regard of eloquence ; In regard of faction ; In regard of the unstableness of the laws ; In regard of the want of secrecy ; That these inconveniences adhere to democracy, forasmuch as men are naturally delighted with the esteem of wit ; The inconveniences of a city arising from a king that is a child ; The power of generals is an evident sign of the excellence of monarchy ; The best state of a city is that where the subjects are the ruler's inheritance ; The nearer aristocracy draws to monarchy, the better it is; the further it keeps from it, the worse --^","Of the internal causes tending to the dissolution of any government : That judging of good and evil belongs to private persons, is a seditious opinion ; That subjects do sin by obeying their princes, is a seditious opinion ; That tyrannicide is lawful, is a seditious opinion ; That those who have the supreme power are subject to the civil laws, is a seditious opinion ; That the supreme power may be divided, is a seditious opinion ; That faith and sanctity are not acquired by study and reason, but always supernaturally infused and inspired, is a seditious opinion ; That each subject hath a propriety or absolute dominion of his own goods, is a seditious opinion ; Not to understand the difference between the people and the multitude, prepares toward sedition ; Too great a tax of monies, though never so just and necessary, prepares toward sedition ;","Ambition disposeth us to sedition ; So doth the hope of success ; Eloquence alone without wisdom, is the only faculty needful to raise seditions ; How the folly of the common people, and the elocution of ambitious men, concur to the destruction of a commonwealth --^","Concerning the duties of them who bear rule : The right of supreme authority is distinguished from its exercise ; The safety of the people is the supreme law ; It behoves princes to regard the common benefit of many, not the peculiar interest of this or that man ; That by safety is understood all many of conveniences ; A query, whether it be the duty of kings to provide for the salvation of their subjects' souls, as they shall judge best according to their own consciences ; Wherein the safety of the people consists ; That discoverers are necessary for the defence of the people ; That to have soldiers, arms, garrisons, and monies in readiness in tie of peace, is also necessary for the defence of the people ; A right instruction of subjects in civil doctrines is necessary for the preserving of peace ; Equal distribution of public offices conduces much to the preservation of peace ; It is natural equity that monies be taxed according to what every man spends,^","not what he possesses ; It conduceth to the preservation of peace to keep down ambitious men ; And to break factions ; Law whereby thriving arts are cherished and great costs restrained, conduce to the enriching of the subject ; That more ought not to be defined by the laws than the benefit of the prince and his subjects requires ; That greater punishments must not be inflicted than are prescribed by the laws ; Subjects must have right done them against corrupt judges --^","Of laws and trespasses : How law differs from counsel ; How from covenant ; How from right ; Division of laws into divine and human; the divine, into natural and positive; and the natural, into the laws of single men and of nations ; The division of human, that is to say, of civil laws, into sacred and secular ; Into distributive and vindicative ; That distributive and vindicative are not species but parts of the laws ; All law is supposed to have a penalty annexed to it ; The precepts of the Decalogue of honoring parents, of murder, adultery, theft, false witness, are civil laws ; It is impossible to command aught by the civil law contrary to the law of nature ; It is essential to a law,^","both that itself and also the lawgiver be known ; When the law giver comes to be known ; Publishing and interpretation are necessary to the knowledge of a law ; The division of the civil law into written and unwritten ; The natural laws are not written laws; neither are the wise sentences of lawyers nor custom laws of themselves, but by the consent of the supreme power ; What the word sin, most largely taken, signifies ; The definition of sin ; The difference between a sin of infirmity and malice ; Under what kind of sin atheism is contained ; What treason is ; That by treason, not the civil but the natural laws, are broken ; And that therefore it is to be punished, not by the right of dominion, but by the right of war ; That obedience is not rightly distinguished into active and passive --^","III.^","Religion : Of the kingdom of God by nature : The proposition of the following contents ; Over whom God is said to rule by nature ; The word of God threefold: reason, revelation, prophecy ; The kingdom of God twofold: natural, and prophetic ; The right whereby God reigns is seated in his omnipotence ; The same proved from scripture ; The obligation of yielding obedience to God proceeds from human infirmity ; The laws of god in his natural kingdom are those which are recited about in chapters 2 and 3 ; What honour and worship is ; Worship consists either in attributes or in actions ; And there is one sort natural, another arbitrary ; One commanded, another voluntary ; What the end or scope of worship is ; What the natural laws are concerning God's attributes ; What the actions are whereby naturally we do give worship ; In God's natural kingdom, the city may appoint what worship of God it pleaseth ; God ruling by nature only, the city, that is to say,^","that man or court who under God hath the sovereign authority of the city, is the interpreter of all the laws ; Certain doubts removed ; What sin is in the natural kingdom of God, and what treason against the divine majesty --^","Concerning those things which are necessary for our entrance into the kingdom of heaven : The difficulty propounded concerning the repugnancy of obeying god and men, is to be removed by the distinction between the point necessary and not necessary to salvation ; All things necessary to salvation are contained in faith and obedience ; What kind of obedience that is which is required of us ; What faith is, and how distinguished from profession, from science, from opinion ; What it is to believe in Christ ; That that article alone, that Jesus is the Christ, is necessary to salvation , is proved from the scope of the evangelists ; From the preaching of the apostles ; From the easiness of Christian religion ; From this also, that it is the foundation of faith ; From the most evident words of Christ and his apostles ; In that article is contained the faith of the old testament ; How faith and obedience concur to salvation ; In a Christian city,^","there is no contradiction between the commands of god and of the city ; The doctrines which this day are controverted about religion, do for the most part relate to the right of dominion."],"note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"Ed. with an introd. by Sterling P.

To do so, it discusses four specific themes: (a) policies governing functioning of standard setting organizations (SSOs), transparency and incentivising future innovation; (b) issue of royalties for standard essential patents (SEPs) and related disputes; (c) due process principles, procedural fairness and best practices in competition law; and (d) coherence of patent policies and consonance with competition law to support innovation in new technologies. Many countries have formulated policies and re-oriented their economies to foster technological innovation as it is seen as a major source of economic growth. At the same time, there have been tensions between patent laws and competition laws, despite the fact that both are intended to enhance consumer welfare. In this regard, licensing of SEPs has been debated extensively, although in most instances, innovators and implementers successfully negotiate licensing of SEPs. However, there have been instances where disagreements on royalty base and royalty rates, terms of licensing, bundling of patents in licenses, pooling of licenses have arisen, and this has resulted in a surge of litigation in various jurisdictions and also drawn the attention of competition/anti-trust regulators. Further, a lingering lack of consensus among scholars, industry experts and regulators regarding solutions and techniques that are apposite in these matters across jurisdictions has added to the confusion. This book looks at the processes adopted by the competition/anti-trust regulators to apply the principles of due process and procedural fairness in investigating abuse of dominance cases against innovators."},"tableOfContents":"Introduction -- 1.

Through a survey of various areas of EU law, including primary and secondary legislation, case law as well as various soft law instruments, Finck introduces two narratives. These are the 'outsider narrative' and the 'insider narrative' that frame these constitutional imaginations. According to the outsider narrative, the structure of the legal order is bi-centric, composed of the member states and the EU only. This narrative envisages SNAs as outsiders of EU law, whose interactions with Union law are merely of an indirect nature. However, in addition to this well-known account of EU law, a parallel yet distinct narrative can be identified according to which SNAs are insiders that entertain direct relations with the European Union and contribute to the substantive development of EU law. It is illustrated that the coexistence of both narratives has wider implications as it points towards a shift in the structure of the European legal order itself, which is transitioning from bi-centricity to polycentricity --Dust jacket."},"tableOfContents":"The status of subnational authorities in EU law -- SNAs in the contemporary European Union -- Subnational authorities as outsiders of EU law -- The insider narrative -- Conclusion.","note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"Michle Finck, Fellow in Law at the School of Economics and Lecturer at Keble College, University of Oxford."},{"@type":"bibliography","#text":"Includes bibliographical references (pages 197-210) and index."}],"subject":[{"geographicCode":{"@authority":"marcgac","#text":"e------"}},{"@authority":"gnd","name":{"@type":"corporate","namePart":"Europische Union"}},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Law","geographic":"European Union countries"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"International and municipal law","geographic":"European Union countries"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Constitutional law","geographic":"European Union countries"},{"topic":"Constitutional law"},{"topic":"International and municipal law"},{"topic":"Law"},{"@authority":"fast","topic":"Constitutional law"},{"@authority":"fast","topic":"International and municipal law"},{"@authority":"fast","topic":"Law"},{"geographic":["Europe","European Union countries"]},{"@authority":"fast","geographic":["Europe","European Union countries"]}],"classification":[{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"KJE960 .F56 2017"},{"@edition":"23","@authority":"ddc","#text":"341.2422/4"},{"@authority":"ddc","#text":"349.497"}],"relatedItem":[{"titleInfo":{"title":"Oxford studies in European law"}},{"@type":"series","titleInfo":{"title":"Oxford studies in European law"}},{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/990152152800203941/catalog"}}],"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"9780198810896"},{"@type":"isbn","#text":"019881089X"},{"@type":"lccn","#text":"^^2017947329"},{"@type":"oclc","#text":"983778917"}],"recordInfo":{"descriptionStandard":"rda","recordContentSource":{"@authority":"marcorg","#text":"NLGGC"},"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"170629"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20180206"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"990152152800203941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)","languageOfCataloging":{"languageTerm":{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"}}},"location":[{"physicalLocation":{"@valueURI":"http://isni.org/isni/000000011940971X","@displayLabel":"Harvard repository","@type":"repository","#text":"Harvard Law School Library, Harvard University"},"shelfLocator":"KJE960 .F56 2017"},"null"],"extension":{"librarycloud":{"HarvardRepositories":{"HarvardRepository":"Law School"},"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc.prod/990152152800203941","priorrecordids":{"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALEPH","#text":"015215280"}},"processingDate":"2018-11-30T17:33Z"}}},{"titleInfo":[{"title":"Glanville Williams","subTitle":"learning the law"},{"@type":"alternative","title":"Learning the law"}],"name":[{"@type":"personal","namePart":["Williams, Glanville Llewelyn",{"@type":"date","#text":"1911-1997"}],"role":[{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"creator"}},{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"author."}}]},{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Smith, A.

Spanning the twentieth century, the book tracks the rise and fall of women-only state protective laws--such as maximum hour laws, minimum wage laws, and night work laws--from their roots in progressive reform through the passage of New Deal labor law to the feminist attack on single-sex protective laws in the 1960s and 1970s. Nancy Woloch considers the network of institutions that promoted women-only protective laws, such as the National Consumers' League and the federal Women's Bureau; the global context in which the laws arose; the challenges that proponents faced; the rationales they espoused; the opposition that evolved; the impact of protective laws in ever-changing circumstances; and their dismantling in the wake of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Above all, Woloch examines the constitutional conversation that the laws provoked--the debates that arose in the courts and in the women's movement. Protective laws set precedents that led to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and to current labor law; they also sustained a tradition of gendered law that abridged citizenship and impeded equality for much of the century.

By applying a multi-disciplinary approach that combines consumers psychology and sellers drafting power in the logic of efficiency and good faith, the book provides a fresh and unconventional analysis of the existing literature, both theoretical and empirical. Moving from the unconscionability doctrine, it criticizes (and in some cases refutes) its main conclusions based on criteria which are usually invoked to sustain the need for public intervention to protect consumers, and specifically related to Law (contract complexity), Psychology (consumer lack of sophistication criterion) and Economics (market structure criterion). It also analyzes the effects of different regulations, such as banning vexatious clauses or mandating disclosure clauses, showing that none of them protect consumers, but in fact prove to be harmful when consumers are more vulnerable, that is whenever sellers can exploit some degree of market power. In closing, the book combines these disparate aspects, arguing that the solution (if any) to the problem of consumer exploitation and market inefficiency associated with the use of contracts of adhesion in these contexts cannot be found in removing or prohibiting hidden clauses, but instead has to take into account the effects of these clauses on the contract as a whole."},"tableOfContents":"1.

By means of a jurisprudential and comparative analysis, the book explores several issues created by the overruling of earlier decisions. Overruling of earlier decisions, when it occurs, operates retrospectively with the effect that it infringes the principle of legal certainty through upsetting any previous arrangements made by a party to a case under long standing precedents established previously by the courts. On this account, in the recent past, a number of jurisdictions have had to deal with the prospect of introducing in their own systems the well-established US practice of prospective overruling whereby the court may announce in advance that it will change the relevant rule or interpretation of the rule but only for future cases. However, adopting prospective overruling raises a series of issues mainly related to the constitutional limits of the judicial function coupledwith the practical difficulties attendant upon such a practice. This book answers a number of the questions raised by this practice. It makes use of the great reservoir of foreign legal experience that furnishes theoretical and practical ideas from which national judges may draw their knowledge and inspiration in order to be able to advise a rational method of dealing with time when they give their decisions."},"tableOfContents":"Foreword -- About the Contributors -- Judicial Rulings with Prospective Effect-from Comparison to Systematization; Eva Steiner -- Part I European Jurisdictions -- The Prospective and Retrospective Effect of Judicial Decisions in Ireland; Niamh Connolly -- Effects in Time of Judgments in the Netherlands: Prospective Overruling and Related Techniques; Remco van Rhee and Wytze van der Woude -- The Temporal Effects of Judicial Decisions in Belgium; Sarah Verstraelen, Patricia Popelier and Sbastien van Drooghenbroeck -- Changing the Case law Pro Future in Germany  A Puzzle of Legal Theory and Practice; Adam Sagan -- Towards a Sophisticated Theory of Precedent - Prospective and Retrospective Overruling in the Czech Legal System; denk Khn -- The Role of Case Law and the Prospective Overruling in the Greek Legal System; Antonios G.

The EU has adopted an approach to climate change that is based on mandatory greenhouse gas emission reductions; it is grounded in 'hard' law measures and accompanied by 'soft' law measures at the regional and Member State level. In contrast, until recently, the US federal government has carefully avoided mandatory emission reduction obligations and focused instead on employing a variety of 'soft' measures to encourage - rather than mandate - greenhouse gas emission reductions in an economically sound, market-driven manner. These macro level differences are critical, yet they mask equally important transatlantic policy convergences. The US and the EU are pivotal players in the development of the international climate change regime. How these two entities structure climate change laws and policies profoundly influences the shape and success of climate change laws and policies at multiple levels of governance. This book suggests that the overall structures and processes of climate change law and policy-making in the US and the EU are intricately linked to international policy-making and, thus, the long-term success of global efforts to address climate change. Accordingly, the book analyzes the content and process of climate change law and policy-making in the US and the EU to reveal policy convergences and divergences, and to examine how these convergences and divergences impact the ability of the global community to structure a sustainable, effective and equitable long-term climate strategy\"--"},"tableOfContents":"A brief history of climate politics and the roles of the US and EU therein -- Law and policy in the United States -- Sub-federal laws and policies in the United States -- Litigation, regulation, and international law as law and policy drivers in the United States -- Law and policy in the European Union -- Member State laws and policies -- US and EU laws and policies compared -- Socio-legal factors influencing US and EU law and policymaking -- Conclusions and the way forward.","note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"Cinnamon Pion Carlarne."},"Bibliographic Level Mode of Issuance: Monograph",{"@type":"bibliography","#text":"Includes bibliographical references and index."},{"@type":"language","#text":"English"}],"subject":[{"geographicCode":[{"@authority":"marcgac","#text":"n-us---"},{"@authority":"marcgac","#text":"e------"}]},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Climatic changes","Law and legislation"],"geographic":"United States"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Greenhouse gas mitigation","Law and legislation"],"geographic":"United States"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Climatic changes","Law and legislation"],"geographic":"European Union countries"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Greenhouse gas mitigation","Law and legislation"],"geographic":"European Union countries"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Climatic changes","Government policy"],"geographic":"European Union countries"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Climatic changes","Government policy"],"geographic":"United States"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Climatic changes","Law and legislation"],"geographic":"United States"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Greenhouse gas mitigation","Law and legislation"],"geographic":"United States"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Climatic changes","Law and legislation"],"geographic":"European Union countries"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Greenhouse gas mitigation","Law and legislation"],"geographic":"European Union countries"},{"@authority":"HILCC","topic":"Law, Politics & Government"},{"@authority":"HILCC","topic":"Law - Non-U.S"},{"@authority":"HILCC","topic":"Law, General & Comparative"},{"@authority":"HILCC","topic":"Law - Europe, except U.K"}],"classification":[{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"K3585.5 .C37 2010"},{"@edition":"22","@authority":"ddc","#text":"344.2404/6342"}],"relatedItem":["null",{"@type":"series","titleInfo":{"title":"Oxford scholarship online"}},{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/99153587476303941/catalog"}}],"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"0-19-159498-9"},{"@type":"lccn","#text":"2010023801"}],"recordInfo":{"descriptionStandard":"aacr","recordContentSource":{"@authority":"marcorg","#text":"DLC"},"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"100607"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20170814"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"99153587476303941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)"},"extension":{"librarycloud":{"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc.prod/99153587476303941","processingDate":"2019-01-29T06:22Z"}},"location":"null"},{"titleInfo":{"title":"Christianity and natural law","subTitle":"an introduction"},"name":{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Doe, Norman","role":{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"editor."}}},"typeOfResource":"text","genre":[{"@authority":"marcgt","#text":"bibliography"},{"@authority":"rdacontent","#text":"text"}],"originInfo":[{"place":{"placeTerm":[{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"code","#text":"enk"},{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"text","#text":"England"}]},"dateIssued":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"2017"},"copyrightDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"2017"},"issuance":"monographic"},{"place":{"placeTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"Cambridge, United Kingdom ;"}},"publisher":"Cambridge University Press,","dateIssued":"2017."}],"language":{"languageTerm":[{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"},{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"text","#text":"English"}]},"physicalDescription":{"form":[{"@authority":"marcform","#text":"print"},{"@type":"media","@authority":"rdamedia","#text":"unmediated"},{"@type":"carrier","@authority":"rdacarrier","#text":"volume"}],"extent":"xvii, 261 pages ; 24 cm."},"abstract":{"@type":"Summary","#text":"\"Historically, natural law has played a pivotal role in Christian approaches to the law, and a contested role in legal philosophy generally.

This book focuses on tobacco litigation in the U.S. wherein 50 historians have witnessed in 314 court cases from 1986 to 2014. The author examines the use of historical arguments in court and investigates how a legal context influences historical narratives and discourse in forensic history. Delafontaine asserts that the courtroom is a performative and fact-making theatre. Nonetheless, he argues that the civic responsibility of the historian should not end at the threshold of the courtroom where history and truth hang in the balance. The book is divided into three parts featuring an impressive range of European and American case studies. The first part provides a theoretical framework on the issues which arise when history and law interact. The second part gives a comparative overview of European and American examples of forensic history."},{"@type":"","#text":"This part also reviews U.S. legal rules and case law on expert evidence, as well as extralegal challenges historians face as experts. The third part covers a series of tobacco-related trials. With remunerations as high as hundreds of thousands of dollars and no peer-reviewed publications or communication on the part of the historians hired by the tobacco companies the question arises whether some historians are willing to trade their reputation and that of their university for the benefit of an interested party.

Numerous organizations, institutions, associations, and groups have emerged alongside the nation-state, each purporting to provide their members with rules and norms to govern their conduct and organize their affairs. The nation-state increasingly finds itself sandwiched, so to speak, between two broad and contrasting categories of non-state law. The first category - law above the state - captures a wide range of legal systems that function across the territorial borders of nation-states. The second category - law below the state - includes various forms of local customary, religious, and indigenous law. Indeed, as these forms of non-state law persist and proliferate alongside the nation-state, the relationship between state and non-state law becomes more complex, multifaceted, and tense. This volume addresses this relationship between the nation-state and these various forms of non-state law, considering whether and to what extent state and non-state law can coexist and how each form of law seeks to influence as well as transform the other.\" -- Page 1 and back cover."},"tableOfContents":"Introduction / Michael A.

Whether it is with reference to symbolic law, psychoanalytical law, religious law, positive law, human rights, to Lacan's, Hegel's, or Kant's philosophies of law, or even to Jewish or Buddhist law, Zizek returns again and again to law. And what his work offers, this volume demonstrates, is a radically new approach to law, and a rethinking of its role within the framework of radical politics.

There is a knowing problem related to applicable law of European origin. This problem consists in two main questions: How are lawyers to know what applicable law is? And, if there is a presumption of other applicable law when practising national law, where is it to be found? These questions must be posed in every case, every advice to be written as well as judgments and rulings that have to be pronounced. What, in a specific case, is the prevailing, applicable law irrespective of whether its origins are national or European? The acknowledgement that these questions must be posed in advance, before solving any case, will make great strides in the current ways of working and classification of legal areas. Also, it will pay scant attention to the existing approach where European law is seen as corpus alienum, which influences national law from outside and creates a hidden civil law. A message is sent to the legal world of civil law: Wake up! European law is part of national law and should be studied as applicable law. It should be recognised and implemented rather than being taken as a separate supplement under the flag of IPL, European law or its impact.

It is a good law, no matter what it does or justifies. The question of one's consent or opposition to any particular law is extraneous to the legality and is regarded merely as a political matter. The assumption is that a certain procedure and logic in law creation has taken place, and the law can be altered by a change in political leaders in a subsequent political election. However, this view and assumption obscure an uncomfortable fact. Some laws can be bad or immoral. Critical legal theory suggests that there are often two (or more) sets of laws, and it makes no difference if Lady Justice is blindfolded or not. Laws change in the process of history, in part, because societal norms change. As common understandings of morality evolve, law adapts itself to the new moral environment. Norms can change slowly or rapidly, even within a lifetime. This book examines both social and legal norms and theories of how they are both created.Christine M. Hassenstab investigates how laws on sterilization, birth control and abortion were created, by focusing on the act of legislation; how the law was driven by scientific and social norms during the first and closing decades of the 20th century in the USA (especially in the state of Indiana) and Norway. The primary focus of Body Law and the Body of Law is the sociology of law and how and why the law changes. The author develops the notion body law for reproductive policies and uses sociological theories to untie the various strands of social history and legal history and looks at two cases of legislation. The book is divided in to two main sections. The first examines eugenic laws in the USA state of Indiana and Norway during the first decades of 20th century. The second part is about the birth control and abortion debate in both countries throughout the late 1960s and 1970s."},"tableOfContents":"Acknowledgements --Abbreviations --Note regarding legal cases and their designation --Introduction --Theories explained and methodology used --Case one: a comparison between Indiana (1907) and Norway (1934) --Case one: legal norm injection points in Indiana and Norway: the selection of particular bodies --Case two: reversals of negative body-law in the United States --Case two: reversals of body-law in Norway: birth control and abortion --Comparisons and conclusions --Appendices --Selected bibliography --Additional literature --List of figures --List of tables --Index.","targetAudience":{"@authority":"marctarget","#text":"specialized"},"note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"Managing editor: Katarzyna Michalak ; associate editor: ukasz Poczyski."},"Bibliographic Level Mode of Issuance: Monograph",{"@type":"bibliography","#text":"Includes bibliographical references and index."},{"@type":"additional physical form","#text":"Also available in print form."},{"@type":"system details","#text":"Mode of access: internet via World Wide Web."},{"@type":"language","#text":"English"}],"subject":[{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Human body","Law and legislation"],"geographic":["United States","Norway"]},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Abortion","Law and legislation"],"geographic":["United States","Norway"]},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Eugenics","Law and legislation"],"geographic":["United States","Norway"]},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Social norms"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Sterilization","Birth control"]},{"@authority":"HILCC","topic":"Law, Politics & Government"},{"@authority":"HILCC","topic":"Law, General & Comparative"}],"classification":{"@edition":"23","@authority":"ddc","#text":"340.2"},"relatedItem":[{"@type":"otherFormat","@displayLabel":"Print version:","@otherType":"Print version:"},{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/99153643087503941/catalog"}}],"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"3110412772"},{"@type":"isbn","#text":"9783110412772"},{"@type":"isbn","@invalid":"yes","#text":"9783110412765"}],"extension":[{"sets":"null"},{"librarycloud":{"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc.prod/99153643087503941","processingDate":"2019-02-24T06:37Z"}}],"recordInfo":{"descriptionStandard":"rda","recordContentSource":{"@authority":"marcorg","#text":"PQKB"},"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"160829"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20190222"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"99153643087503941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)"},"location":["null","null"]},{"titleInfo":{"title":"Competition law and standard essential patents","subTitle":"a transatlantic perspective"},"name":{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Petrovi, Urka","role":[{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"creator"}},{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"author."}}]},"typeOfResource":"text","genre":[{"@authority":"marcgt","#text":"bibliography"},{"@authority":"rdacontent","#text":"text"}],"originInfo":[{"place":{"placeTerm":[{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"code","#text":"ne"},{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"text","#text":"Netherlands"}]},"dateIssued":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"2014"},"copyrightDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"2014"},"issuance":"monographic"},{"place":{"placeTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"Alphen aan den Rijn, The Netherlands :"}},"publisher":"Kluwer Law International,","dateIssued":[2014]},{"place":{"placeTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"Frederick, MD :"}},"publisher":"Aspen Publishers, Inc.,","dateOther":{"@type":"distribution","#text":[2014]}}],"language":{"languageTerm":[{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"},{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"text","#text":"English"}]},"physicalDescription":{"form":[{"@authority":"marcform","#text":"print"},{"@type":"media","@authority":"rdamedia","#text":"unmediated"},{"@type":"carrier","@authority":"rdacarrier","#text":"volume"}],"extent":"x, 217 pages ; 25 cm."},"abstract":[{"@type":"Summary","#text":"Despite the substantial benefits of standards in today's economy, the recent advent of standard essential patents (SEPs) - which protect proprietary technologies essential for industry standards - has tended to create a setting for anticompetitive practices that, at least potentially, harms competition and consumer welfare.

It also provides a comprehensive and highly informative overview of the latest developments at the international level, important cross-disciplinary issues and different approaches in national legislation. The book is divided into four sections. Forewords by internationally renowned academics and politicians are followed by an analysis of the content and structure of the Sustainable Development Goals with regard to soil and land as well as the scientific methods for their implementation. In addition, all relevant international regimes are discussed, including the latest developments, such as the decisions made at the 12th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The next section deals with cross-disciplinary issues relevant to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals like the right to food, land tenure, migration and the Economics of Land Degradation initiative. The last section gathers reports on the development of national legislation from various nations and supra-national entities, including Brazil, China, the European Union, Mongolia, Namibia and the United States. Addressing this broad range of key topics, the book offers an indispensible tool for all academics, legislators and policymakers working in this field. The International Yearbook of Soil Law and Policy is a book series that discusses the central questions of law and politics with regard to the protection and sustainable management of soil and land  at the international, national and regional level."},"tableOfContents":"Part I: Words of Welcome from All Continents:  -- Greeting to the launch of the Yearbook from an African Perspective -- Audit of Soil Governance .-Soils need international governance - A European perspective for the first volume of the International Yearbook of Soil Law and Policy -- North American Soils and World Food -- Soils Governance, an Australian perspective Striving for Land-Soil Sustainability: Some Legal Reflections -- Part II: Recent Developments of Soil Regulation at International Level: International Soil Protection Law  History, Concepts and Latest Developments -- Chances and Challenges in Using the Sustainable Development Goals as a New Instrument for Global Action Against Soil Degradation -- Land Degradation Neutrality and the UNCCD: From Political Vision to Measurable Targets -- The Role of Soils in International Climate Change Policy -- The UN Convention on Biological Diversity and Soils: Status and Future Options -- The Alpine Conventions Soil Conservation Protocol: A Model Regime? -- Are Soils Taken Into Consideration by the IPBES Assessment on Land Degradation and Restoration? -- Part III: Cross-cutting Topics: Soil Degradation and Migrations in the Age of the Global Environmental Crisis: A Policy-making Perspective -- FAO - Voluntary Guidelines on Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Forests and Fisheries  Relevance, Reception and First Experiences in Implementation -- Evaluating the Role of Private Land Tenure Rights in Sustainable Land Management for Agriculture in Kenya -- The Human Right to Food and Sustainable Soil Management: Linking Voluntary Agricultural Sustainability Standards with Food Security -- Economics of Land Degradation: Achievements and Next Steps -- Part IV: National and Regional Soil Legislation: National Developments in Soil Protection in Mongolia -- The Protection of Soil Under Namibian Law -- Brazilian Federal Court of Accounts (TCU), Department of Agriculture and Environmental Audit  Soil Governance Audit -- Legislative Progress on Soil Contamination Prevention and Control in China -- The Protection of Soil  Does the European Union Live Up to its Own Ambitions? -- United States Soil Degradation.","note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"edited by Harald Ginzky, Irene L.

The party autonomy rule is the cornerstone of any modern system of choice of law; embodying as it does the freedom enjoyed by parties to a cross-border legal relationship to agree on the law applicable to it. However, as this study shows, the rule has a major shortcoming because it fails to give due regard to contractual function of the choice of law agreement. The study examines the existing law on choice of law agreements, by reference to the law of both common and civil law jurisdictions and international instruments. Moreover, it suggests a new coherent approach to party autonomy that integrates both the law of contract and choice of law. This important new study should be read with interest by private international law scholars."},"tableOfContents":"Introduction -- Selection of the applicable law by contract -- The scope of party autonomy -- Independence of the choice of law contract -- Regulating the choice of law contract -- Agreement to choose the applicable law -- Formation of the choice of law contract -- Validity of the choice of law contract -- Conclusion.","note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"Maria Hook."},"Based on author's thesis (doctoral - Victoria University of Wellington, 2014).",{"@type":"bibliography","#text":"Includes bibliographical references and index."}],"subject":[{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Conflict of laws"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Liberty of contract"},{"@authority":"fast","topic":"Conflict of laws"},{"@authority":"fast","topic":"Liberty of contract"},{"topic":"Contracts pertaining to choice of law"}],"classification":[{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"K7068 .H66 2016"},{"@edition":"23","@authority":"ddc","#text":"340.9"}],"relatedItem":[{"titleInfo":{"title":"Studies in private international law ;

Sargentich shows how two different kinds of legal argument - rule-based reasoning and reasoning based on principles and policies - share a surprising kinship and serve the same aspiration.

In pursuit of liberal legality, courts work to uphold people's legal entitlements and to confer evenhanded legal justice. Judges try to achieve the control of reason in law, which is manifest in law's coherence, and to avoid forms of arbitrariness, such as personal moral judgment. Sargentich offers a unified theory of the diverse ways of doing law, and shows that they all arise from the same root, which is a commitment to liberal legality\"--"},{"@type":"Summary","#text":"\"Legality is our topic.

These papers trace the burgeoning field of international sports law from its origins about a half-century ago, through the course of complex challenges ranging from political boycotts of competition to doping of athletes, corruption, discrimination, players' rights and commercial influences such as broadcast rights. Within a unique institutional framework of national, international, non-governmental and inter-governmental authority, the emerging regime of public law is of fundamental importance not only to the sports industry and bar but, quite obviously, to a global public. This authoritative collection puts particular emphasis on the central role of the Olympic Movement and affiliated sports federations, the regional mechanism of the European Union and the characteristics of the European and North American sports models. The collection will be of interest and value to students, researchers, academics and practitioners interested in international sports law."},"tableOfContents":["Recommended readings (Machine generated): Kalevi Heinila (1966), 'Notes on the Inter-Group Conflicts in International Sport', International Review of Sport Sociology, 1, 31-8 -- James A.R.

Nevertheless, the last few decades have shown a harsher reality, where natural resources have also triggered, financed or fuelled a number of internal armed conflicts. Examples include the armed conflicts in Cambodia, Sierra Leone, Liberia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which have been financed with the exploitation of a variety of valuable natural resources, including diamonds, gold, timber, oil and cocoa. The aim of this book is to assess the contribution of international law in ensuring that natural resources are used to promote development and to achieve sustainable peace instead of financing armed conflict. For this purpose, the author discusses the international legal framework for the governance of natural resources in States in general, in situations of armed conflict and as part of conflict resolution and post-conflict peacebuilding efforts\"--"},{"@type":"Summary","#text":"\"Established in 1946, this series produces high quality scholarship in the fields of public and private international law and comparative law.

Private international law is now often affected by international conventions, and the issues faced by classical conflicts rules are frequently dealt with by substantive harmonisation of law under international auspices. Mixed international arbitrations, especially those involving state economic activity, raise mixed questions of public and private international law, while in many fields (such as the protection of human rights and democratic standards, investment guarantees and international criminal law) international and national systems interact. National constitutional arrangements relating to 'foreign affairs', and to the implementation of international norms, are a focus of attention\"--"}],"tableOfContents":"1. Introduction -- Part I.

The book puts forward a definition of the criminalisation of migration as the three-fold process whereby migration management takes place via the adoption of substantive criminal law, via recourse to traditional criminal law enforcement mechanisms including surveillance and detention, and via the development of mechanisms of prevention and pre-emption. The book provides a typology of criminalisation of migration, structured on the basis of the three stages of the migrant experience: criminalisation before entry (examining criminalisation in the context of extraterritorial immigration control, delegation and privatisation in immigration control and the securitisation of migration); criminalisation during stay (examining how substantive criminal law is used to regulate migration in the territory); and criminalisation after entry and towards removal (examining efforts to exclude and remove migrants from the territory and jurisdiction of EU Member States and criminalisation through detention). The analysis focuses on the impact of the criminalisation of migration on human rights and the rule of law, and it highlights how European Union law (through the application of both the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and general principles of EU law) and ECHR law may contribute towards achieving decriminalisation of migration in Europe."},"tableOfContents":"1.

Four countries were selected as primary examples of these two legal traditions: the United States, England and Wales, Germany and Poland. The first layer of analysis focuses on selected elements of the model of accusation that are crucial to the model adopted by the ICC. These are: development of the notion of the prosecutors independence in view of their ties to the countries and the Security Council; the nature and limits of the prosecutors discretional powers to initiate proceedings before the ICC; the reasons behind the prosecutors choice of both defendants and charges; the role the prosecutor plays in the procedure of disclosure of evidence and consensual termination of proceedings; and the determinants of the model of accusation used during trial and appeal proceedings. The second layer of the book consists in an analysis of the motives behind applying particular solutions to create the model of accusation before the ICC. It also shows how the model of accusation gradually evolved in proceedings before the military and ad hoc tribunals: ICTY and ICTR. Moreover, the question of compatibility of procedural institutions is addressed: In what ways does adopting a certain element of criminal procedure, e.g. discretional powers of the prosecutor to initiate criminal proceedings, influence the remaining procedural elements, e.g. the existence of the dossier of a case or the powers of a judge to change the legal classification of the criminal behavior appearing in the indictment?"},"tableOfContents":"The procedure before international criminal tribunals -- Prosecutor as an organ of international criminal tribunals -- Initiation of an investigation -- Judicial control of an accusation -- Obligations of the prosecutor related to the accused's right to information -- Influence of the prosecutor on the consensual termination of criminal proceedings -- Powers of the prosecutor before the Trial Chamber -- Powers of the prosecutor in the appeal proceedings -- Conclusion.","note":{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"by Hanna Kuczyska."},"subject":[{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"International criminal law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Law"},{"topic":"Sources and Subjects of International Law, International Organizations"},{"topic":"Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law"},{"topic":"International Humanitarian Law, Law of Armed Conflict"},{"topic":"Theories of Law, Philosophy of Law, Legal History"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Law","Philosophy"]},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Conflict of laws"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Conflict of laws"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"International law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Comparative law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Humanitarian law"}],"classification":[{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"KZ7000-7500"},{"@edition":"23","@authority":"ddc","#text":"345"}],"relatedItem":[{"@type":"otherFormat","@displayLabel":"Printed edition:","@otherType":"Printed edition:"},{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/990143935600203941/catalog"}}],"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"9783319176260"},{"@type":"isbn","#text":"9783319176260"},{"@type":"isbn","#text":"9783319176253"},{"@type":"doi","#text":"10.1007/978-3-319-17626-0"}],"recordInfo":{"descriptionStandard":"aacr","recordContentSource":{"@authority":"marcorg","#text":"Springer"},"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"150507"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20180405"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"990143935600203941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)"},"location":{"url":{"@access":"raw object","#text":"https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:hul.ebookbatch.SPRGR_batch:201804059783319176260"}},"extension":{"librarycloud":{"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc.prod/990143935600203941","priorrecordids":{"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALEPH","#text":"014393560"}},"processingDate":"2018-11-30T02:20Z"}}},{"titleInfo":[{"title":"International investment law"},{"@type":"alternative","title":"International investment law","subTitle":"a handbook"}],"name":[{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Bungenberg, Marc","role":{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"editor."}}},{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Griebel, Jrn","role":{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"editor."}}},{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Hobe, Stephan","role":{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"editor."}}},{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Reinisch, August","role":{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"editor."}}},{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Kim, Yun-I","role":{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"editor."}}},{"@type":"corporate","namePart":"International Investment Law Centre Cologne","role":{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"associated with work."}}},{"@type":"corporate","namePart":["Universitt Wien","Institut fr Europarecht, Internationales Recht und Rechtsvergleichung."]}],"typeOfResource":"text","genre":[{"@authority":"marcgt","#text":"bibliography"},{"@authority":"rdacontent","#text":"text"}],"originInfo":[{"place":{"placeTerm":[{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"code","#text":"gw"},{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"text","#text":"Germany"}]},"dateIssued":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"2015"},"copyrightDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"2015"},"edition":"First edition.","issuance":"monographic"},{"place":{"placeTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"Mnchen, Germany :"}},"publisher":"C.H.

This volume is a tribute to the breadth and depth of activity at the Asian Law Center over its first five decades, and a treasure trove of substantive insights into comparative law in Asia. As Asian law continues to attract more attention around the world, we must all be grateful for the contributions of the innovators who built the field.'--Tom Ginsburg, University of Chicago Law School, US. 'Professors Haley and Takenaka have put together a wonderfully eclectic collection of essays to commemorate the founding of the Asian Law Center at the University of Washington School of Law in 1964.^ Written by leaders in their respective fields, the essays, which explore legal developments, innovations and transplants in Japan and its neighbours, will appeal to scholars and students of Japanese law, as well as comparative lawyers with an interest in Asian law.'--Jean Ho, National University of Singapore. 'For fifty years now, the University of Washington's Asian Law Center has stood at the center of American scholarship on Japanese law. Its scholars have consistently produced the very best work in the field, and men and women associated with it have increasingly turned their attention to other legal systems in Asia as well. In this broad-ranging volume, the contributors explore the intriguing connections among the many legal systems at stake. They have produced a tantalizing blend of analytical depth and geographical breadth.'--J. Mark Ramseyer, Harvard Law School, US.^ Legal Innovations in Asia explores how law in Asia has developed over time as a result of judicial interpretation and innovations drawn from the legal systems of foreign countries. Expert scholars from around the world offer a history of law in the region while also providing a wider context for present-day Asian law. The contributors share insightful perspectives on comparative law, the role of courts, legal transplants, intellectual property, Islamic law and other issues as they relate to the practice and study of law in Japan, China, Taiwan, Korea and Southeast Asia. Students and scholars of Asian law will find this a timely and fascinating read, as will legal practitioners and colleagues of the Asian Law Center."},"tableOfContents":"pt. 1.

The book puts forward a definition of the criminalisation of migration as the three-fold process whereby migration management takes place via the adoption of substantive criminal law, via recourse to traditional criminal law enforcement mechanisms including surveillance and detention, and via the development of mechanisms of prevention and pre-emption. The book provides a typology of criminalisation of migration, structured on the basis of the three stages of the migrant experience: criminalisation before entry (examining criminalisation in the context of extraterritorial immigration control, delegation and privatisation in immigration control and the securitisation of migration); criminalisation during stay (examining how substantive criminal law is used to regulate migration in the territory); and criminalisation after entry and towards removal (examining efforts to exclude and remove migrants from the territory and jurisdiction of EU Member States and criminalisation through detention). The analysis focuses on the impact of the criminalisation of migration on human rights and the rule of law, and it highlights how European Union law (through the application of both the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and general principles of EU law) and ECHR law may contribute towards achieving decriminalisation of migration in Europe."},"tableOfContents":"1.

The Handbook is first and foremost intended for practitioners and legal scholars, but its approachable style makes it readily accessible for students. The Handbook provides the reader with a thorough grounding in the EEA Agreement, detailing how secondary EU law becomes applicable in the EFTA pillar, and the roles played by the EFTA Surveillance Authority and the EFTA Court. It considers the EEA Agreement from the respective perspectives of the national authorities, courts, and the legal professions of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The book meticulously examines substantive EEA law, beginning with the general principles and the four freedoms, through competition law and State aid to such aspects as the precautionary principle, tax law and mutual administrative and legal assistance. Emphasis is placed on jurisprudence and especially that of the EFTA Court. Each chapter has been written by a judge, noted practitioner or eminent academic in their respective fields and the book is divided into twelve parts: Part I History and main features of the EEA Agreement Part II Genesis of EEA Law Part III Institutions and Procedure Part IV National Authorities in the EFTA Pillar Part V National Courts in the EFTA Pillar Part VI The Practicing Bar in the

In spite of nature conservation efforts worldwide, many ecosystems including those critical for human well-being have been damaged or destroyed. States and citizens need a new vision of how humans can reconnect with the natural environment. With its focus on the long-term holistic recovery of ecosystems, ecological restoration has received increasing attention in the past decade from both scientists and policymakers. Research on the implications of ecological restoration for the law and law for ecological restoration has been largely overlooked. This is the first published book to examine comprehensively the relationship between international environmental law and ecological restoration. While international environmental law (IEL) has developed significantly as a discipline over the past four decades, this book enquires whether IEL can now assist states in making a strategic transition from not just protecting and maintaining the natural environment but also actively restoring it. Arguing that states have international duties to restore, this book offers reflections on the philosophical context of ecological restoration and the legal content of a duty to restore from an international law, European Union law and national law perspective. The book concludes with a discussion of several contemporary themes of interest to both lawyers and ecologists including the role of private actors, protected areas and climate change in ecological restoration.\"--"},"tableOfContents":"What is ecological restoration? -- Why should we restore? -- International soft law and ecological restoration -- International conventions and ecological restoration -- The convention on biological diversity and ecological restoration -- Regional approaches : law and policy on ecological restoration in the European Union -- National approaches to ecological restoration -- Private non-state actors and ecological restoration -- Protected areas and ecological restoration -- Climate change and ecological restoration -- Future directions for International law on ecological restoration.","note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"Anastasia Telesetsky, An Cliquet, and Afshin Akhtar-Khavari."},{"@type":"bibliography","#text":"Includes bibliographical references (pages 297-314) and index."}],"subject":[{"@authority":"gnd","topic":"Sanierung"},{"@authority":"gnd","topic":"Umweltschaden"},{"@authority":"gnd","topic":"Internationales Umweltrecht"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Environmental law, International"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Restoration ecology","Law and legislation"]},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Nature conservation","Law and legislation"]},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Biodiversity conservation","Law and legislation"]},{"@authority":"fast","topic":["Biodiversity conservation","Law and legislation"]},{"@authority":"fast","topic":"Environmental law, International"},{"@authority":"fast","topic":["Nature conservation","Law and legislation"]},{"@authority":"fast","topic":["Restoration ecology","Law and legislation"]}],"classification":[{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"K3478 .T444 2017"},{"@edition":"23","@authority":"ddc","#text":"344.04/6"}],"relatedItem":[{"titleInfo":{"title":"Routledge research in international environmental law"}},{"@type":"series","titleInfo":{"title":"Routledge research in international environmental law"}},{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/990149268300203941/catalog"}}],"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"9781138796836 (hbk)"},{"@type":"isbn","#text":"1138796832 (hbk)"},{"@type":"isbn","@invalid":"yes","#text":"9781315757605 (ebk)"},{"@type":"lccn","#text":"^^2016029641"},{"@type":"oclc","#text":"952470665"}],"recordInfo":{"descriptionStandard":"rda","recordContentSource":{"@authority":"marcorg","#text":"DLC"},"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"160624"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20170407"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"990149268300203941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)","languageOfCataloging":{"languageTerm":{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"}}},"location":[{"physicalLocation":{"@valueURI":"http://isni.org/isni/000000011940971X","@displayLabel":"Harvard repository","@type":"repository","#text":"Harvard Law School Library, Harvard University"},"shelfLocator":"K3478 .T444 2017"},"null"],"extension":{"librarycloud":{"HarvardRepositories":{"HarvardRepository":"Law School"},"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc.prod/990149268300203941","priorrecordids":{"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALEPH","#text":"014926830"}},"processingDate":"2019-02-07T06:24Z"}}},{"titleInfo":{"title":"Flexibility in modern business law","subTitle":"a comparative assessment"},"name":[{"@type":"personal","namePart":["Fenwick, Mark",{"@type":"termsOfAddress","#text":"(Law teacher)"}],"role":{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"editor."}}},{"@type":"personal","namePart":["Wrbka, Stefan",{"@type":"date","#text":"1976-"}],"role":{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"editor."}}}],"typeOfResource":"text","genre":[{"@authority":"marcgt","#text":"bibliography"},{"@authority":"rdacontent","#text":"text"}],"originInfo":[{"place":{"placeTerm":[{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"code","#text":"ja"},{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"text","#text":"Japan"}]},"dateIssued":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"2016"},"copyrightDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"2016"},"issuance":"monographic"},{"place":{"placeTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"Tokyo, Japan :"}},"publisher":"Springer,","dateIssued":[2016]}],"language":{"languageTerm":[{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"},{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"text","#text":"English"}]},"physicalDescription":{"form":[{"@authority":"marcform","#text":"print"},{"@type":"media","@authority":"rdamedia","#text":"unmediated"},{"@type":"carrier","@authority":"rdacarrier","#text":"volume"}],"extent":"vii, 229 pages ;

In certain situations, music is used as an accompaniment, oftentimes simply a set of sounds designed to subconsciously affect the listener. While in other situations, music is the central point, dominating the dialogue yet continuing to subconsciously affect the listener. Law, on a similar note, is a concept that is inescapable. Legal scholars have noted for centuries that society in the United States evolved, and continues to evolve, toward a population dependent on law. Both music and law remain fundamental components of modern American life and there are no signs that our connection and reliance on music and law will change in the future. This book addresses the role music plays in constituting law in the United States.^"},{"@type":"Summary","#text":"The subject of the book is important in order to show that while the Supreme Court writes decisions and legislators create and modify statutes, music is more invasive and influential in the lives of the populous. The book's first purpose is to introduce readers to the classic jurisprudential schools of thought and connect those philosophies to the lyrics of various songs. There is clear evidence that Natural Law and Legal Positivism have been instrumental in establishing a legal structure and philosophy of law. The remnants of those jurisprudential schools can be directly seen in the lyrics of the last 50 years. The book notes that greater attention should be paid to the music since it is in actuality, non-traditional jurisprudence. After classic jurisprudence is presented, the book undertakes Constitutive Theory and connects lyrics to this critical approach of law.^"},{"@type":"Summary","#text":"The book's second objective is to systematically explain the role that music plays in constituting images of Race, Gender, and Class. Legal scholars have argued that music and law are often loosely connected but this book asserts that music creates law and images of law through specific lenses. Critical Race Theory, Feminist Legal Theory, and underclass literature are the best examples of how music has explicitly infected legal circles. The book highlights the impact that musicians have in constituting law through their lyrics. When musicians remind the listener of the injustices in society, call for social change, or give their interpretation of legal theory, an image of law is constituted and that image often becomes the Law. When musicians create music, they are simultaneously creating law. Their experiences, language, and motives encompass their being and develop an image of law, which the listener subsequently adopts.^"},{"@type":"Summary","#text":"Their lyrics constitute what law is for \"the people\" which is often a direct response to the State's version of what law is or should be.

Roman law nowadays is studied in many different ways, which is reflected in the diversity of approaches in the essays. Some focus on how the law evolved in ancient Rome, others on its place in the daily life of the Roman citizen, still others on how Roman legal concepts and doctrines have been deployed through the ages. All of them are responses to one and the same thing: the sheer intellectual vitality of Roman law, which has secured its place as a central element in the intellectual tradition and history of the West.

Kaczorowski, Director of the Condon Institute of Legal History, immerses readers in the story of Fordham Law School from the day it opened its doors in 1905 in the midst of massive changes in the United States, in the legal profession, and in legal education. Kaczorowski explores why so many immigrants and their children needed the founding of Catholic law schools in order to enter the legal profession in the first half of the twentieth century. He documents how, in the 1920s and 30s, when the legal profession's elites were actively trying to raise barriers that would exclude immigrants, Dean Wilkinson and the law faculty at Fordham were implementing higher standards while simultaneously striving to make Fordham the best avenue into the legal profession for New York City's immigrants.  Tracing Fordham Law School's history in the context of developments in legal education over the course of the twentieth century, this book pinpoints those factors that produce greatness in a law school and those that contribute to its decline. Fordham University School of Law: A History shows and explains why, prior to World War II, Fordham was one of the leading law schools in America and, along with Columbia, one of the top two law schools in New York City. As one of those leading schools, Fordham was in the vanguard of legal education reform, and its faculty made important contributions to legal scholarship.   Fordham University School of Law: A History also reveals that, after World War II, the Law School suffered a decline, primarily because of inadequate funding resulting from the university's fiscal policies. These policies brought the university's administration into direct conflict with the American Bar Association (ABA) and the Association of American Law Schools (AALS), which consistently observed that the Law School was being starved for funds compared to its peer schools, with the result that peer law schools were improving their quality while Fordham was in decline. The conflict, which did not approach resolution at Fordham until the last quarter of the century, was replicated throughout legal education, especially in Catholic universities yet, this is the first scholarly work to document and explain it.   Kaczorowski's wonderfully contextualized, meticulously documented history of Fordham Law School brings readers right up to the present day and traces how the Law School, with the unprecedented financial support and active involvement of its alumni, is resuming its prior position as one of the nation's leading law schools\"--"}],"tableOfContents":["Machine generated contents note: .","The founding of the Fordham University School of Law -- Fordham Law School during World War I and its aftermath -- The quest for excellence in an era of bigotry -- The great depression and educational reform -- World War II and its aftermath -- Modernizing Fordham Law School -- Struggle for autonomy -- Resurgence of Fordham Law School."],"note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"Robert J.

Current essential and global topics such as principles of environmental law, climate change, biodiversity, ethics pertaining to animal rights , nuclear safety regime after Fukushima, environmental impact assessments, protecting international waters, genetically-modified organisms, and implementing international instruments, and EU rules at the national level are discussed in light of the 2009 Treaty of Lisbon and other recent international treaties, by comparing the approaches taken by the EU, European countries, and Japan. As environmental law is not just a national issue but also a global one, it is important to understand and analyse various aspects of current environmental issues. This book is a response to such needs, and represents the joint work of five Japanese and four European (two German and two Italian) professors who have succeeded in creating something that is both unique and remarkable. ."},"tableOfContents":"1 Introduction: The Impact of the International and European Union Environmental Law on Japanese Basic Environmental Law (Yumiko Nakanishi) -- 2 The Scope of the EUs Competences on the Field of the Environment (Alexander Proelss).-3 Principles of EU Environmental Law: An Appraisal (Alexander Proelss).-4 The Aarhus Convention and cases of non-compliance with environment impact assessment requirements: The EU and Japan (Yuko Minami -- 5 Policies Towards Tackling Climate Change and Their Compatibility with the WTO (Kiyotaka Morita) -- 6 The Principle of Animal Welfare in the EU and Its Influence in Japan and the World (Yumiko Nakanishi) -- 7 Protectiong Biodiversity in Europe: The Habitats and Birds Directives and Their Application in Italy in an Evolving Perspective (Sara De Vido) -- 8 The Challenge of Regulation Genetically Modified Organisams in the European Union: Trends and Issues (Hans-Georg Dederer -- 9 The Proliferation of Marine Protected Areas under International Law, European Union Law and Japanese Law (Chie Sato) -- 10 Environmental Damage Remediation in Japan: A Comparative Assessment (Andrea Ortolani) -- 11 Challenges and Prospects for the Nuclear Safety Regime in Japan and in the European Union after Fukushima (Kyoji Kawasaki and Ryoko Kusumi).

Labour lawyers have tended to regard migration law as generally speaking outside their purview, and migration lawyers have somewhat similarly tended to neglect labour law. The culmination of a collaborative project on 'Migrants at Work' funded by the John Fell Fund, the Society of Legal Scholars, and the Research Centre at St John's College, Oxford, this volume brings together distinguished legal and migration scholars to examine the impact of migration law on labour rights and how the regulation of migration increasingly impacts upon employment and labour relations. Examining and clarifying the interactions between migration, migration law, and labour law, contributors to the volume identify the many ways that migration law, as currently designed, divides the objectives of labour law, privileging concerns about the labour supply and demand over worker-protective concerns. In addition, migration law creates particular forms of status, which affect employment relations, thereby dividing the subjects of labour law. Chapters cover the labour laws of the UK, Australia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Germany, Sweden, and the US. References are also made to discrete practices in Brazil, France, Greece, New Zealand, Mexico, Poland, and South Africa. These countries all host migrants and have developed systems of migration law reflecting very different trajectories. Some are traditional countries of immigration and settlement migration, while others have traditionally been countries of emigration but now import many workers. There are, nonetheless, common features in their immigration law which have a profound impact on labour law, for instance in their shared contemporary shift to using temporary labour migration programmes."},"tableOfContents":["Migrants at work and the division of labour law / Mark Freedland and Cathryn Costello -- Precarious pasts, precarious futures / Bridget Anderson -- Employers and migrant legality : liberalization of service provision, transnational posting, and the bifurcation of the European labour market / Georg Menz -- Immigration and labour market protectionism : protecting local workers' preferential access to the national labour market / Martin Ruhs -- Migrant workers in agriculture : a legal perspective / ACL Davies -- The EU's internal market and the fragmentary nature of EU labour migration / Elspeth Guild -- Migration status in labour and social security law : between inclusion and exclusion in Italy / Silvana Sciarra and William Chiarmonte -- The sectoral regulatory regime : when work migration controls and the sectorally differentiated labour market meet / Einat Albin --","Migrants, unfree labour, and the legal construction of domestic servitude : migrant domestic workers in the UK / Judy Fudge and Kendra Strauss -- Migrant labour in the United States : working beneath the floor of free labour? / Maria Ontiveros -- Enforcement of employment rights by migrant workers in the UK : the case of EU-8 nationals / Catherine Barnard -- The right of irregular immigrants to back pay : the spectrum of protection in international, regional, and the national legal systems / Elaine Dewhurst -- Employer checks on immigration status and employment law / Bernard Ryan -- Migrant workers and the right to non-discrimination and equality / Shauna Olney and Ryszard Cholewinski -- Migrant rights under the European Social Charter / Colm O'Cinnide -- Black women workers and discrimination : exit, voice, and loyalty ... or 'shifting'? / Iyiola Solanke -- Migration, labour law, and religious discrimination / Lucy Vickers --","Reconciling openness and high labour standards? : Sweden's attempts to regulate labour migration and trade in services / Samuel Engblom -- Links between individual employment law and collective labour law : their implications for migrant workers / Alan Bogg and Tonia Novitz -- Organizing against abuse and exclusion : the associational rights of undocumented workers / Virginia Mantouvalou -- Home from home : migrant domestic workers and the International Labour Organization Convention on Domestic Workers / Sandra Fredman -- Conflicted priorities? : Enforcing fairness for temporary migrant workers in Australia / Mary Crock, Sean Howem and Ron McCallum AO."],"note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"edited by Cathryn Costello, Andrew W.

Some chapters seek to articulate a unifying framework for understanding public law, while others seek to demonstrate the plurality of public law through the method of legal taxonomy. A number of chapters analyse whether different fields such as human rights and administrative law are merging, with others considering specific unifying themes or concepts in public law. The chapters in Part 2 offer comparative perspectives, charting and analysing convergence and divergence across common law systems. Specific topics include standing, proportionality, human rights, remedies, use of foreign precedents, legal transplants, and disunity and unity among subnational jurisdictions."},"tableOfContents":"Introduction / Mark Elliott, Jason N.E.

Until very recently, lawyers in the Western tradition studied natural law as part of their training, and the task of the judicial system was to put its tenets into concrete form, building an edifice of positive law on natural law's foundations. Although much has been written about natural law in theory, surprisingly little has been said about how it has shaped legal practice. Natural Law in Court asks how lawyers and judges made and interpreted natural law arguments in England, Europe, and the United States, from the beginning of the sixteenth century to the American Civil War. R.H. Helmholz sees a remarkable consistency in how English, Continental, and early American jurisprudence understood and applied natural law in cases ranging from family law and inheritance to criminal and commercial law. Despite differences in their judicial systems, natural law was treated across the board as the source of positive law, not its rival. The idea that no person should be condemned without a day in court, or that penalties should be proportional to the crime committed, or that self-preservation confers the right to protect oneself against attacks are valuable legal rules that originate in natural law. From a historical perspective, Helmholz concludes, natural law has advanced the cause of justice\"--Unedited summary from book jacket."},"tableOfContents":"Legal education in continental Europe -- The law of nature in European courts -- Legal education in England -- The law or nature in English courts -- Legal education in the United States -- The law of nature in American courts.","note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"R.H.

However, the study of animal law as an academic discipline and as part of legal education is a recent development in Australasia. Animal Law in Australia and New Zealand aims to contribute to establishing and furthering animal law as an independent branch of legal studies in these countries. Part I of the book focuses on the philosophical, scientific and historical aspects of animals in relation to law, providing the background against which animal law can be examined as a discipline and a branch of law. It considers the legal status of animals and raises questions as to whether the entrenched legal status of animals as property should be changed or modified in furtherance of animal protection. Part II of the book focuses on animal law in practice in Australia and New Zealand, covering legal frameworks for animal welfare law and an overview of the key provisions of the relevant laws. Later chapters detail the regulation of the treatment of companion animals, farm animals, wild animals and animals used in research. Animal Law in Australia and New Zealand is an introductory text covering animal law in Australasia and is ideal for university law students undertaking animal law, animal welfare law or animal rights courses; academics interested in animal welfare and the environment in general; lawyers who are interested in animal welfare and environment; animal rights advocates; and general readers with an interest in animal welfare.\" -- Back cover."},"tableOfContents":"Animals : morality, science and justice -- Historical development of animal law -- Legal status of animals -- Overview of animal law in Australia and New Zealand -- Animal welfare legislation -- Regulation of the treatment of companion animals -- Regulation of the treatment of farm animals -- Regulation of wild animal welfare -- Regulation of animal testing.","note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"Deborah Cao ; with contributions by Katrina Sharman, Steven White."},{"@type":"bibliography","#text":"Includes bibliographical references and index (p. 283-305) and index."}],"subject":[{"geographicCode":[{"@authority":"marcgac","#text":"u-at---"},{"@authority":"marcgac","#text":"u-nz---"}]},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Animals","Law and legislation"],"geographic":"New Zealand"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Animals","Law and legislation"],"geographic":"Australia"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Animal welfare","Law and legislation"],"geographic":"Australia"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Animal welfare","Law and legislation"],"geographic":"New Zealand"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Animal rights","geographic":"Australia"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Animal rights","geographic":"New Zealand"}],"classification":[{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"KVB702.5 .C36 2010"},{"@edition":"22","@authority":"ddc","#text":"344.049"}],"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"9780455226187"},{"@type":"lccn","#text":"^^2010551536"},{"@type":"oclc","#text":"608397267"}],"recordInfo":{"descriptionStandard":"aacr","recordContentSource":{"@authority":"marcorg","#text":"DLC"},"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"110408"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20111114"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"990126308700203941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)"},"relatedItem":{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/990126308700203941/catalog"}},"location":[{"physicalLocation":{"@valueURI":"http://isni.org/isni/000000011940971X","@displayLabel":"Harvard repository","@type":"repository","#text":"Harvard Law School Library, Harvard University"},"shelfLocator":"KVB702.5 .C36 2010"},"null"],"extension":{"librarycloud":{"HarvardRepositories":{"HarvardRepository":"Law School"},"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc.prod/990126308700203941","priorrecordids":{"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALEPH","#text":"012630870"}},"processingDate":"2018-11-30T08:27Z"}}},{"titleInfo":{"nonSort":"The  ","title":"Matrix of Insanity in Modern Criminal Law"},"name":{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Halevi, Gavriel","role":[{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"creator"}},{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"author."}}]},"typeOfResource":"text","genre":[{"@authority":"marcgt","#text":"government publication"},{"@authority":"rdacontent","#text":"text"}],"originInfo":[{"place":{"placeTerm":[{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"code","#text":"gw"},{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"text","#text":"Germany"}]},"dateIssued":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"2015"},"issuance":"monographic"},{"place":{"placeTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"Cham :"}},"publisher":"Springer International Publishing :","dateIssued":"2015."}],"language":{"languageTerm":[{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"},{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"text","#text":"English"}]},"physicalDescription":{"form":[{"@authority":"marcform","#text":"electronic"},{"@type":"media","@authority":"rdamedia","#text":"computer"},{"@type":"carrier","@authority":"rdacarrier","#text":"online resource"}],"extent":"XIII, 204 p. 5 illus. online resource."},"abstract":{"@type":"Summary","#text":"This book challenges the assumptions of modern criminal law that insanity is a natural, legally and medically defined phenomenon (covering a range of medical disorders).

It also covers the institutional framework for these issues, the related human rights aspects, and the connections with other areas of EU law, like the free movement of EU citizens. Steve Peers' seminal text on the justice and home affairs law of the European Union appears in its fourth edition and is now available in two separate volumes covering asylum and immigration law, and criminal law, policing, and civil law, and as a two-volume set. It provides a detailed examination of EU legislation and case law on the issues of immigration, asylum, visas, border controls, and police and criminal law cooperation, discussing the impact and ongoing development of EU law.

The book evaluates whether the duty of utmost good faith (the cornerstone of insurance and takaful contracts) is effectively regulated and, in turn, observed by insurers (and takaful operators) and insureds alike in Malaysia. The adequacy of the Insurance Act 1996 (Malaysia), the Takaful Act 1984 (Malaysia), the Financial Services Act 2013 (Malaysia) and the Islamic Financial Services Act 2013 (Malaysia) is evaluated, along with the supporting infrastructure and oversight measures introduced by the Malaysian government.

The book contains 278 EU law-related charts (primary, secondary and case law) dealing with the following issues: introduction to the subject, the development of European integration, institutions, competences of the EU, the making of secondary law, the nature of EU law, introduction to substantive law, the internal market, competition law, social law, legal integration and enforcement. Firstly, the charts are intended as a learning tool for students as well as for practitioners endeavouring to brush up on their EU law skills. Indeed most people understand and memorise complex or abstractcontent more easily if they have some form of visual aid at their disposal. Secondly, these charts are intended as a presentation tool. Whether lecturing on EU law in a university, explaining an issue of EU law to a client or making a presentation before the board of directors of a company, visual tools can be highly useful. The new second reprint of the book has been updated in order to follow the development of EU law in the time lapsed since the publication of the first reprint (2010). About the Authors: Christa Tobler is a professor at both the Universities of Leiden (the Netherlands) and of Basel (Switzerland), where she teaches EU law. In her research, she places a particular emphasis on the issues of legal equality and discrimination, both in economic and in social law. Jacques Beglinger is an attorney-at-law practicing in Zurich (Switzerland). He received his legal training in Switzerland, France and the United States. His background is in industrial law with a specialisation in international commercial law including, in particular, the areas of technology, e-business and media.

In earlier times law and justice were viewed as virtually synonymous. However, experience has taught us that injustice may in fact be supported by law. Nonetheless, the belief remains that justice is the special concern of law. Commentators from Plato to Derrida have called law to account in the name of justice, asked that law provide a language of justice, and demanded that it promote the attainment of justice. They have done so in abstract language as if the demands of justice could only be apprehended accurately outside of history and context. The justice that is usually spoken about is elusive, if not illusory, and disconnected from the embodied practice of law.\"--BOOK JACKET. \"Furthermore, the very meaning of justice, especially as it relates to law, is in dispute.^"},{"@type":"Review","#text":"Justice may refer to distributional issues or it may involve primarily procedural questions, impartiality in judgment, or punishment and recompense. The considerable disagreement over the meaning of justice suggests to some that we lack a full and coherent account of justice. This uncertainty does not mean that justice necessarily should be jettisoned from legal discourse. Rather, we are reminded of the vastness of the relationship of law and justice, of the difficulty of constructing a single account capable of holding together its many strands, and of the space that exists to theorize anew about justice and injustice in law and legal theory.\"--BOOK JACKET.^"},{"@type":"Review","#text":"\"The essays collected in Justice and Injustice in Law and Legal Theory seek to remedy this uncertainty about the meaning of justice and its disembodied quality by embedding inquiry about justice in an examination of law's daily practices, its institutional arrangements, and its engagement with particular issues at particular moments in time. The essays examine the relationship between law and justice and injustice in specific issues and practices and, in doing so, make the question of justice come alive as a concrete political question. They draw on the disciplines of history, law, anthropology, and political science.\"--BOOK JACKET."}],"tableOfContents":"Legal justice and injustice : toward a situated perspective / Thomas R.

The book compares the legislative frameworks of e-commerce in the EU, US, China and International Organisations. It sets out solutions to modernise and harmonise laws at the national, regional and international levels in response to the current technological developments. The second edition of this book has been fully updated taking into account both the changes in the use of technologies and developments in the law. The new edition provides information on the key legal challenges caused by the increasing popularity of cloud computing, particularly relating to data protection and jurisdiction, and considers how greater legal certainty can be achieved in cloud computing service contracts. The growth in use of automated computing systems to issue international contracts of sale is addressed in terms of what this may mean for the purpose of determining jurisdiction and existing conflict of law rules.The book discusses the recent UNCITRAL ODR Procedural Rules and explores how best to ensure consumer redress in cross-border e-commerce transactions by looking into the detail of the recent Proposal for a Regulation on Online Dispute Resolution for Consumer Protection in the EU.

While each is a discrete subject area, they have a shared thread of encompassing \"common\" areas of the oceans, space and the Antarctic continent. From Jessup's important 1927 piece on Maritime Jurisdiction to contemporary writings on outer space law and the evolution of the Antarctic Treaty, Moore compiles a comprehensive collection of influential American scholarship spanning more than 80 years on the world's shared resources, often revealing the importance of United States foreign policy in the development of each of these areas.

It describes and evaluates the development of contemporary peace processes and the peace agreements that emerge. The book sets out what is in essence an anatomy of peace agreement practice and interrogates its relationship to law. At its heart the book grapples with the role of law in ending violent conflict and the broader questions this raises for the relationship of law to social change. Law potentially plays two key roles with respect to peace agreements: first, to the extent that peace agreements themselves form legal documents, law plays a role in the 'enforcement' or implementation of the peace agreement; second, international law has a relationship to peace agreement negotiation and content, in its regulatory guise. International Law regulates self-determination, transitional justice, and the role of third parties. The book documants and analyses these two roles of law. In doing so, the book reveals a complex dynamic relationship between the peace agreement as a legal document and the role of international law in which international law and concepts of domestic constitutionalism are being re-shaped. The practice of negotiating peace agreements is argued to be producing a new law of the peacemaker-or lex pacificatoria that connects developments in international law with new forms of domestic constitutional law in a set of hybrid relationships. This law of the peacemaker potentially forms part of a broader 'law of peace' that moves beyond the traditional concept of law of peace as merely 'the rest of international law' once the laws of war are subtracted. The new lex pacificatoria stands as an account of the way in which international law shapes and is shaped by peace agreements. The book proposes an ambivalent response to 'this new law' which connects to contemporary debates about the force of international law and its appropriate relationship with domestic constitutonalism."}],"tableOfContents":"Acknowledgements; Table of Cases; table of Treaties, Conventions, and Other international Instruments; Prologue; INTRODUCTION; 1.

Nelson begins with colonial and postcolonial efforts to introduce shari'ah into an environment tied to \"tribal\" custom. He then examines the way in which electoral accountability came to privilege those who could simultaneously sustain Islamic law \"in theory\" and customary law \"in practice.\" Drawing attention to the interaction of formal and informal legal and political institutions over time, Nelson argues that a deeper understanding of the relationship between Islam and democracy requires a more sophisticated appreciation of the complex legal strategies adopted by individual Muslims. --Book Jacket."}],"tableOfContents":"Who owns the land?

Immigration law, in contrast, was confined to immigration courts housed within the executive branch of the federal government and staffed by immigration attorneys, immigration judges, and prosecutors employed for many years by the Immigration and Naturalization Service and now the Departments of Homeland Security or Justice.

It challenges the traditional approach to the definition of well-known trade mark, that is \"we do not know what it is, but we all know when we see it\" and sets out a new theoretical model for defining well-known trade marks\"--"},{"@type":"Summary","#text":"\"This book considers the effectiveness of well-known trade mark protection at an international level. It particularly considers EU trade mark law from Japanese perspectives, and provides a practical and critical overview of trade mark law in Japan, including the historical development of the law and the recent development on cases and policy. The book includes detailed coverage of the Japanese Unfair Competition Prevention Act, and contains the first systematic analysis of Japanese jurisprudence and legislative amendments of law in relation to well-known trade marks and unfair competition. The book goes on to comparatively analyse Japanese trade mark law alongside that of the European Community Trade Mark system. The book critically considers the difficulties in comprehensively defining a 'well-known trade mark' in the relevant international trade mark instruments. In breaking down the traditional definition of the 'well-known trade mark', the book works to address existing theoretical ambiguities in the application of trade mark law.

Comparing and contrasting these two giant nations can be highly beneficial as China and India were the two fastest-growing economies in the last three decades, and together their populations make up one third of the worlds total population; as such, exploring how to sustain their growth via innovation and commercialization of IPR could have a tremendous positive impact on global well-being. While a study of these two mega countries with such diverse dimensions and magnitudes can never be truly comprehensive, this joint effort by scholars from law, business management and economics disciplines that pursues an empirical approach makes a valuable contribution. Divided into three parts, the first offers an in-depth doctrinal and empirical analysis.

In 2007 Estonia suffered a month long cyber assault to its digital infrastructure, described in cyberspace as 'Web War I'. In 2010, a worm Stuxnet was identified as having infected and damaged Iran's uranium enrichment plant, presumably in an attempt to set back Iran's nuclear programme. This book takes a detailed look at these new theatres of war and considers their relation to international law on the use of force. Except in cases of self-defence or with the authorisation of a Security Council Resolution, the use of force is prohibited under the UN charter and customary international law. However, the law of jus ad bellum was developed in a pre-digital era where current technological capabilities could not be conceived. Jackson Maogoto asks whether the law on the use of force is able to deal with legal disputes likely to arise from modern warfare. Key queries include, how one defines an armed attack in an age of anti-satellite weaponry, whether the destruction of a State's vital digital eco-system or the \"blinding\" of military communication satellites constitutes a threat, and how one delimits the threshold that would enliven the right of self-defence or retaliatory action. The book argues that while technology has leapt ahead, the legal framework has failed to adapt, rendering States unable to legally defend themselves effectively.

First, the importance of administrative organisations for the implementation of regulatory law towards banks and financial institutions is shown. On this basis five model types of administrative organisations in the field of banking regulation are derived. Thereby, banking regulators can be classified due to their influence on regulatory decisions. Their influence runs from preparation across enforcement to control of regulatory decisions. In particular, the cooperation of the European Central Bank with national banking regulators is analysed. Finally, the main legal and economic arguments of Banking Regulation in the Economic and Monetary Union are discussed."},"tableOfContents":"Introduction -- Administrative Organisation of Banking Regulation -- Models of the Administration of Banking Regulation -- Theses about the Organisation of Banking Regulations -- Summary.","note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"by Alexander Wellerdt."},"Description based upon print version of record.",{"@type":"bibliography","#text":"Includes bibliographical references."},{"@type":"language","#text":"English"}],"subject":[{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Management"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Private international law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Conflict of laws"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"International law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Comparative law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Trade"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Law and economics"},{"topic":"Law"},{"topic":"International Economic Law, Trade Law"},{"topic":"European Law"},{"topic":"Management"},{"topic":"Law and Economics"},{"topic":"Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law"}],"classification":[{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"K3820-3836"},{"@authority":"ddc","#text":"330 340 340.2 340.9 341.2422 343.07 650"}],"relatedItem":[{"titleInfo":{"title":"SpringerBriefs in Law"}},"null",{"@type":"series","titleInfo":{"title":"SpringerBriefs in Law"}},{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/99153644244103941/catalog"}}],"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"3-319-17638-2"},{"@type":"doi","#text":"10.1007/978-3-319-17638-3"}],"recordInfo":{"descriptionStandard":"rda","recordContentSource":{"@authority":"marcorg","#text":"MiAaPQ"},"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"150331"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20170918"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"99153644244103941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)","languageOfCataloging":{"languageTerm":{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"}}},"extension":{"librarycloud":{"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc.prod/99153644244103941","processingDate":"2018-11-30T16:24Z"}},"location":"null"},{"titleInfo":[{"title":"International sales law"},{"@type":"alternative","title":"International sales law","subTitle":"a guide to the CISG"},{"@type":"alternative","title":"Guide to the CISG"},{"@type":"alternative","title":"Guide to the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods"},{"@type":"alternative","title":"Guide to the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods"}],"name":[{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Schwenzer, Ingeborg H.","role":{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"creator"}}},{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Fountoulakis, Christiana"},{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Dimsey, Mariel"}],"typeOfResource":"text","genre":[{"@authority":"lcgft","#text":"Casebooks (Law)"},{"@authority":"fast","#text":"Casebooks."}],"originInfo":{"place":[{"placeTerm":[{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"code","#text":"enk"},{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"text","#text":"England"}]},{"placeTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"Oxford"}},{"placeTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"Portland, Or"}}],"publisher":"Hart","dateIssued":["c2012",{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"2012"}],"edition":"2nd ed.","issuance":"monographic"},"language":{"languageTerm":[{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"},{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"text","#text":"English"}]},"physicalDescription":{"form":{"@authority":"marcform","#text":"print"},"extent":"xlii, 800 p. ; 25 cm."},"abstract":{"@type":"Summary","#text":"Rev. ed. of : International sales law / edited by Ingeborg Schwenzer and Christiana Fountoulakis.

One influential answer is that the criminal law vindicates pre-political rights and condemns wrongdoing. On this account, the criminal law has an intrinsic subject matter-certain types of moral wrongdoing-and it provides a distinctive response to that wrongdoing, namely condemnatory punishment. 0In Criminal Law in the Age of the Administrative State, Vincent Chiao offers an alternative, public law account. What the criminal law is for, Chiao suggests, is sustaining social cooperation with public institutions. Consequently, we only have reason to support the use of the criminal law insofar as its use is consistent with our reasons for valuing the social order established by those institutions. By starting with the political morality of public institutions rather than the interpersonal morality of private relationships, this account shows how the criminal law is continuous with the modern administrative and welfare state, and why it is answerable to the same political virtues.0Chiao sketches a democratic egalitarian account of those virtues, one that is loosely consequentialist, egalitarian but not equalizing, and centered on a form of freedom-effective access to central capabilities-as its currency of evaluation. From this point of view, the role of the criminal law is to help public institutions create a society in which each person can lead a life as a peer among peers. Chiao shows how a democratic egalitarian approach to criminal justice provides a fresh perspective on a range of contemporary problems, from mass incarceration to overcriminalization, due process and the collateral consequences of a criminal conviction."},"tableOfContents":"Criminal law as public law 1: context -- Criminal law as public law 2: structure -- Criminal law as public law 3: content -- Mass incarceration and the theory of punishment -- Criminal law in the age of the administrative state -- Formalism and pragmatism in criminal procedure -- Responsibility without resentment.","note":{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"Vincent Chiao."},"subject":[{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Criminal law","Philosophy"]},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Criminal justice, Administration of"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Public law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Administrative law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Welfare state"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Criminal procedure"},{"@authority":"fast","topic":"Administrative law"},{"@authority":"fast","topic":"Criminal justice, Administration of"},{"@authority":"fast","topic":["Criminal law","Philosophy"]},{"@authority":"fast","topic":"Criminal procedure"},{"@authority":"fast","topic":"Public law"},{"@authority":"fast","topic":"Welfare state"}],"classification":[{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"K5018 .C53 2018"},{"@edition":"23","@authority":"ddc","#text":"345"}],"relatedItem":[{"titleInfo":{"title":"Studies in penal theory and philosophy"}},{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/99153736009303941/catalog"}}],"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"9780190273941"},{"@type":"isbn","#text":"0190273941"},{"@type":"isbn","#text":"9780190920838"},{"@type":"isbn","#text":"0190920831"},{"@type":"lccn","#text":"2018013395"},{"@type":"oclc","#text":"1029094947"}],"recordInfo":{"descriptionStandard":"rda","recordContentSource":{"@authority":"marcorg","#text":"DLC"},"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"180319"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20190104"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"99153736009303941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)","languageOfCataloging":{"languageTerm":{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"}}},"location":[{"physicalLocation":{"@valueURI":"http://isni.org/isni/000000011940971X","@displayLabel":"Harvard repository","@type":"repository","#text":"Harvard Law School Library, Harvard University"},"shelfLocator":"K5018 .C53 2018"},"null"],"extension":{"librarycloud":{"HarvardRepositories":{"HarvardRepository":"Law School"},"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc.prod/99153736009303941","processingDate":"2019-02-10T06:22Z"}}},{"titleInfo":{"title":"International law as a profession"},"name":[{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Aspremont, Jean d'","role":{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"editor."}}},{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Gazzini, Tarcisio","role":{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"editor."}}},{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Nollkaemper, Andr","role":{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"editor."}}},{"@type":"personal","namePart":["Werner, W.

Currie offers an overview of those branches of international law commonly referred to as \"international criminal law\" (ICL) and \"transnational criminal law\" (TCL).

In his treatment of ICL, Professor Currie examines the major international crimes -- genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and aggression--against the backdrop of those international courts set up to deal with these crimes, such as the Nuremberg and Tokyo Tribunals, the UN ad hoc tribunals, and the International Criminal Court. The discussion of TCL focuses on conduct that is considered to be criminal by the domestic law of states, but which has aspects affecting more than one state.

The CRAs are blamed for awarding risky securities 3-A investment grade status and then failing to downgrade them quickly enough when circumstances changed, which led to investors suffering substantial losses. The causes identified by the regulators for the gatekeeper failure were conflicts of interest (as the issuers of these securities pay for the ratings); lack of competition (as the Big Three CRAs have dominated the market share); and lack of regulation for CRAs. The book examines how the regulators, both in the US and EU, have sought to address these problems by introducing soft law self-regulation in accordance with the International Organisation of Securities Commissions Code and hard law statutory regulation, such as that found in the Reform Act and Dodd-Frank Act in the US and similar provisions in the EU.^ The highly topical book examines these provisions in detail by using a doctrinal black-letter law method to assess the success of the regulators in redressing the problems identified. It also examines the US case law regulation relating to the legal liability of CRAs. The book examines whether the regulations introduced have had a deterrent effect on the actions of CRAs, whether investors are compensated for their losses, and how the regulators have dealt with the issues of conflicts of interest and an anti-competitive environment. Should liability be introduced for CRAs through changes in the law so as to compel them to issue reliable ratings and solve the current problems? The book seeks to simplify the complex issues involved and is backed by concrete evidence; as such, it will appeal to both the well-informed and the lay general public who are interested in learning more about the role of CRAs in the sub-prime mortgage crisis and regulators attempts to remedy the situation.^ Novice readers can familiarise themselves with the legal and financial terminology used by referring to the glossary at the end of the book."},"tableOfContents":"1.

Legislation, as a source of law, is often highly political, and is the product of a process or the creation of officials often closely bound into party politics. Legislation is also one of the exclusive powers of the state. As such, legislation is plainly both practical and inevitably political; at the same time most understandings of the relationship between law and politics have been overwhelmingly theoretical. In this light, public law is often seen as part of the political order or as inescapably partisan. We know relatively little about the real impact of law on politicians through their legal advisers and civil servants. How do lawyers in government see their roles and what use do they make of law? How does politics actually affect the drafting of legislation or the making of policy? This volume will begin to answer these and other questions about the practical, day-to-day relationship between law and politics in a number of settings. It includes chapters by former departmental legal advisers, drafters of legislation, law reformers, judges and academics, who focus on what actually happens when law meets politics in government\"--Unedited summary from book jacket."},"tableOfContents":"Beginning at the beginning : the relationships between politics and law / David Feldman -- Lawyers, MPs and judges / Ross Cranston -- Lawyers in the House of Commons / David Howarth -- The form and language of legislation / Alan Rodger -- Legislation and politics / Stephen Laws -- Whitehall, transparency, and the law / David Seymour -- The role of public international laywers in government / Michael Wood -- Government legal advisers through the ethics looking glass / Matthew Windsor -- Law reform in a political environment  : the work of the Law Commissions / Elizabeth Cooke and Hector MacQueen -- Parliament Act 1911 in its historical context / Philip Norton -- The Parliament Act 1949 / Chris Ballinger -- The realities of the Parliament Act 1911 / Daniel Greenberg -- The impact of the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 on a government's management of its legislative timetable, on parliamentary procedure and on legislative drafting / Rhodri Walters -- International law and Great Power politics / Matthew Parish -- Law and democracy in a human rights framework / Philip Sales -- Politics, law and constitutional moments in the UK / Dawn Oliver -- Looking back and moving on / David Feldman.","note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"edited by David Feldman."},{"@type":"bibliography","#text":"Includes bibliographical references and index."}],"subject":[{"geographicCode":{"@authority":"marcgac","#text":"e-uk---"}},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Law","Political aspects"],"geographic":"Great Britain"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Law reform","Political aspects"],"geographic":"Great Britain"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Government attorneys","Political activity"],"geographic":"Great Britain"},{"@authority":"fast","topic":["Law","Political aspects"]}],"classification":[{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"KD640 .L39 2013"},{"@edition":"23","@authority":"ddc","#text":"340.115"}],"relatedItem":[{"titleInfo":{"title":"Hart studies in constitutional law ; volume 3"}},{"@type":"series","titleInfo":{"title":"Hart studies in constitutional law ; v. 3"}},{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/990139153510203941/catalog"}}],"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"1849464731"},{"@type":"isbn","#text":"9781849464734"},{"@type":"oclc","#text":"830370396"}],"recordInfo":{"descriptionStandard":"rda","recordContentSource":{"@authority":"marcorg","#text":"YDXCP"},"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"130318"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20140403"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"990139153510203941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)","languageOfCataloging":{"languageTerm":{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"}}},"location":[{"physicalLocation":{"@valueURI":"http://isni.org/isni/000000011940971X","@displayLabel":"Harvard repository","@type":"repository","#text":"Harvard Law School Library, Harvard University"},"shelfLocator":"KD640 .L39 2013"},"null"],"extension":{"librarycloud":{"HarvardRepositories":{"HarvardRepository":"Law School"},"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc.prod/990139153510203941","priorrecordids":{"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALEPH","#text":"013915351"}},"processingDate":"2019-01-22T06:03Z"}}},{"titleInfo":{"title":"Regulating flexible work"},"name":{"@type":"personal","namePart":"McCann, Deirdre M.","role":{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"creator"}}},"typeOfResource":"text","genre":["text",{"@authority":"marcgt","#text":"Electronic books"}],"originInfo":{"place":[{"placeTerm":[{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"code","#text":"enk"},{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"text","#text":"England"}]},{"placeTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"Oxford"}}],"publisher":"Oxford University Press","dateIssued":["c2008",{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"2008"}],"issuance":"monographic"},"language":{"languageTerm":[{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"},{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"text","#text":"English"}]},"physicalDescription":{"form":[{"@authority":"gmd","#text":"electronic resource"},{"@authority":"marccategory","#text":"electronic resource"},{"@authority":"marcsmd","#text":"remote"},{"@type":"media","@authority":"","#text":"computer"},{"@type":"carrier","@authority":"","#text":"online resource"}],"extent":"1 online resource (xxiv, 198 p. )"},"abstract":{"@type":"","#text":"This work examines the regulation of 'flexible' or 'non-standard' forms of work, including part-time, temporary and temporary agency work.

She then considers how soft law has also been instrumental in the fight against malaria and tuberculosis. Using these compelling case studies, this book explores law-making on global health and analyzes the viability of current global health financing trends within new and traditional organizations such as the UN, WHO, UNAIDS, UNITAID and The Global Fund.

It identifies the key research questions for water law and policy while providing an overview of the current global water governance regime, its evolving characteristics, and the legal theories involved in these changes. It focuses on water law and discusses the characteristics of national, supranational, and international water law through a combination of case studies and thematic chapters. The Evolution of the Law and Politics of Water is the first volume to take a global perspective on the evolution of water law and policy. It describes global patterns and sets forth the particulars of eight national legal systems drawn from every continent and five regional or supranational systems, as well as the body of customary international law as a whole. In particular, it is the first book to explore the interrelation between culture, religion, government and law in water governance and management. The volume is, therefore, a must-read for anyone interested in how water governance has changed through time and in different places as well as anyone interested in how water law has sought to channel water governance through time and in different places and what variables account for the relative success (or lack of success) of water law in performing this channelling function.

The global space economy reached $330 billion in 2015, with a growth rate of 9% vis-a-vis the previous year. Consequently, Space Law is changing and expanding expeditiously, especially at the national level. More laws and regulations are being adopted by space-faring nations, while more countries are adapting their Space Laws and regulations related to activities in outer space. More regulatory bodies are being created, while more regulatory diversity (from public law to private law) is being instituted as increasing and innovative activities are undertaken by private entities which employ new technologies and business initiatives. At the international level, Space Law (both hard law and soft law) is expanding in certain areas, especially in satellite broadcast and telecommunications. The Handbook summarises the existing state of knowledge on a comprehensive range of topics and aspires to set the future international research agenda by indicating gaps and inconsistencies in the existing law and highlighting emerging legal issues. Unlike other books on the subject, it addresses major legal aspects of particular space activities and issues, rather than providing commentary on or explanations about a particular Space Law treaty or national regulation."},"tableOfContents":"Preface / Ram S.

In addition to a separate chapter devoted exclusively to media ethics by Michael Farrell, a new chapter on international and foreign law by Dr. Kyu Ho Youm has also been added. Resources on the companion website include updated PowerPoint presentations, an instructor manual, and a sample syllabus for instructors, and study guides, practice quizzes, and all seven of the book's original appendices for students.

This expansion seems set to continue as more countries seek accession and the scope of EU law expands, touching more and more aspects of its citizens' lives. The EU has never been stronger and yet it now appears to be reaching a crisis point, beset on all sides by conflict and challenges to its legitimacy. Nationalist sentiment is on the rise and the Eurozone crisis has had a deep and lasting impact. EU law, always controversial, continues to perplex, not least because it remains difficult to analyse. What is the EU? An international organization, or a federation? Should its legal concepts be measured against national standards or another standard? The Oxford Handbook of European Union Law illuminates the richness and complexity of the debates surrounding the law and policies of the EU. Comprising eight section, it examines how we are to conceptualize EU law; the architecture of EU law; making and administering EU law; the economic constitution and the citizen; regulation of the market place; economic, monetary, and fiscal union; the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice; and what lies beyond the regulatory state. Each chapter summarizes, analyses, and reflects on the state of play in a given area, and suggests how it is likely to develop in the foreseeable future. Written by an international team of leading commentators, this Oxford Handbook creates a vivid and provocative tapestry of the key issues shaping the laws of the European Union\"--Unedited summary from book jacket."},"tableOfContents":["Part I: Conceptualizing EU Law -- The philosophy of European Union law / Neil Walker -- Legal reasoning in EU law / Jan Komarek -- Straddling the fence: the EU and international law / Jan Klabbers -- Part II: The Architecture of EU Law -- EU competences: existence and exercise / Robert Schutze -- Legal acts and hierarchy of norms in EU law, Deirdre Curtin and Tatevik Manucharyan -- Accession and withdrawal in the law of the European Union / Christoph Hillion -- The Court of Justice of the European Union / Michal Bobek -- Primacy and the national reception / Monica Claes -- Direct effect, effective judicial protection, and state liability / Dorota Leczykiewicz -- Human rights in the EU / Andrew Williams -- Common external policies: common commercial policy, common foreign and security policy, common security and defence policy / Panos Koutrakos -- Part III: Making and Administering EU Law -- The democratic ambiguity of EU law-making and its enemies / Damian Chalmers --","Comitology / Alexander Turk -- The evolution of infringement and sanction procedures: of pilots, diversions, collisions, and circling / Melanie Smith -- Judicial review in the European Union / Anthony Ar"null" -- Dialogue with national courts / Takis Tridimas -- Accountability and representation in EU law / Paul Craig -- Part IV: The Economic Constitution and the Citizen -- The free movement of workers in the 21st century / Eleanor Spaventa -- The developing legal dimensions of Union citizenship / Niamh Nic Shuibhne -- Goods / Kenneth Armstrong -- Establishment / Zoe Adams and Simon Deakin -- The law on the free movement of services: powerful, but not always persuasive / Gareth Davies -- Part V: Regulation of the Market Place -- The complex weave of harmonization / Loic Azoulai -- Competition and merger law and policy / Okeoghene Odudu -- Competition law enforcement / Alison Jones -- An evolutionary theory of state aid control / Andrea Biondi and Elisabetta Righini --","EU intellectual property: exercises in harmonization / Catherine Seville -- Part VI: Economic, Fiscal, and Monetary Union -- The metamorphosis of European economic and monetary union / Fabian Amtenbrink -- Financial markets regulation / Niamh Moloney -- Death, taxes, and (targeted) judicial dynamism: the free movement of capital in EU law / Thomas Horsley -- Direct taxation and the fundamental freedoms / Paul Farmer -- Part VII: The Area of Freedom, Security, and Justice -- EU criminal law under the area of freedom, security, and justice / Christopher Harding -- EU migration and asylum law under the area of freedom, security, and justice / Nadine El-Enany -- The harmonization of civil jurisdiction / Richard Fentiman -- Part VIII: Beyond the Regulatory State?

The analysis is divided into three periods  the origins and Cold War period, post-Cold War period and the twenty-first century  and assesses the resolutions passed in each period by thematic category.

This book aims to bring Critical Race Theory to a European context. Outlining its development in North America, and bringing its insights to bear upon European law and legal scholarship, the book considers Critical Race Theory's relevance in Europe, and particularly in civil law traditions, where the relationship between race and law is often presented as anodyne. Redressing the almost exclusive European focus and reading of anti-racism in terms of anti-Semitism, the conflation of race and racism with issues related to citizenship and religion, and the more general reluctance to speak of race, the book outlines the elements of a European Critical Race Theory. For law, it is demonstrated, is just as deeply involved in constructing, discriminating and subordinating racial minorities in the European context as it is in the American one even if, as this book shows, it does so in different ways /"},{"@type":"Summary","#text":"\"The CRT approach adopted in this book illustrates the reasons why the relationship between race and law in European civil law jurisdictions is far from anodyne. Law plays a critical role in the construction, subordination and discrimination against racial minorities in Europe, making it comparable, albeit in slightly different ways, to the American experience of racial discrimination. Anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, anti-Roma and anti-Black racism constitute a fundamental factor, often tacitly accepted, in the relationship between law and race in Europe. Consequently, the broadly shared anti-race and anti-racist position is problematic because it acts to the detriment of victims of racism while privileging the White, Christian, male majority /"}],"tableOfContents":"Critical race theory: The historical context -- Critical race theory: Its genealogy and writings -- Transplanting critical race theory to Europe -- Towards a european critical race theory -- Contextualising a european ciritical race theory -- Conclusions.","note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"Mathias Mschel."},{"@type":"bibliography","#text":"Includes bibliographical references (pages 193-217) and index."}],"subject":[{"geographicCode":[{"@authority":"marcgac","#text":"e-----"},{"@authority":"marcgac","#text":"n-us---"}]},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Race discrimination","Law and legislation"],"geographic":"Europe"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Minorities","Legal status, laws, etc"],"geographic":"Europe"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Critical legal studies"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Race discrimination","Law and legislation"],"geographic":"United States"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Minorities","Legal status, laws, etc"],"geographic":"United States"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Law","Philosophy"]},{"@authority":"bisacsh","topic":"LAW / General"},{"@authority":"bisacsh","topic":"LAW / Comparative"},{"@authority":"bisacsh","topic":"LAW / Discrimination"},{"@authority":"lcsh","geographic":"United States","topic":["Race relations","Philosophy"]},{"@authority":"lcsh","geographic":"Europe","topic":["Race relations","Philosophy"]},{"topic":"Law and race"}],"classification":[{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"KJC5144.M56 M67 2014"},{"@edition":"23","@authority":"ddc","#text":"342.408/73"},{"@authority":"bisacsh","#text":"LAW000000 LAW016000 LAW094000"}],"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"9780415739306 (hardback)"},{"@type":"isbn","#text":"0415739306 (hardback)"},{"@type":"isbn","@invalid":"yes","#text":"9781315816739 (ebk.)"},{"@type":"isbn","@invalid":"yes","#text":"1315816733 (ebk.)"},{"@type":"lccn","#text":"^^2014005760"},{"@type":"oclc","#text":"868199811"}],"recordInfo":{"descriptionStandard":"rda","recordContentSource":{"@authority":"marcorg","#text":"DLC"},"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"140210"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20141104"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"990142220980203941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)","languageOfCataloging":{"languageTerm":{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"}}},"relatedItem":{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/990142220980203941/catalog"}},"location":[{"physicalLocation":{"@valueURI":"http://isni.org/isni/000000011940971X","@displayLabel":"Harvard repository","@type":"repository","#text":"Harvard Law School Library, Harvard University"},"shelfLocator":"KJC5144.M56 M67 2014"},"null"],"extension":{"librarycloud":{"HarvardRepositories":{"HarvardRepository":"Law School"},"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc.prod/990142220980203941","priorrecordids":{"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALEPH","#text":"014222098"}},"processingDate":"2018-11-30T17:23Z"}}},{"titleInfo":{"title":"Rule of law and fundamental rights","subTitle":"critical comparative analysis of constitutional review in the United States, Germany and Mexico"},"name":{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Narvez Medcigo, Alfredo","role":[{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"creator"}},{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"author."}}]},"typeOfResource":"text","genre":[{"@authority":"marcgt","#text":"bibliography"},{"@authority":"rdacontent","#text":"text"}],"originInfo":[{"place":{"placeTerm":[{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"code","#text":"sz"},{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"text","#text":"Switzerland"}]},"dateIssued":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"2016"},"copyrightDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"2016"},"issuance":"monographic"},{"place":{"placeTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"Cham ;"}},"publisher":"Springer,","dateIssued":[2016]}],"language":{"languageTerm":[{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"},{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"text","#text":"English"}]},"physicalDescription":{"form":[{"@authority":"marcform","#text":"print"},{"@type":"media","@authority":"rdamedia","#text":"unmediated"},{"@type":"carrier","@authority":"rdacarrier","#text":"volume"}],"extent":"xv, 262 pages ; 24 cm"},"abstract":{"@type":"Summary","#text":"\"This book, which originated from the broadly held view that there is a lack of rule-of-law in Mexico, and from the emphasis of traditional academia on cultural elements as the main explanation, explores the question of whether there is any relationship between the system of constitutional review (and thus the 'law' as such) and the level of rule-of-law in a given state. To do so, it elaborates a theoretical model for achieving rule-of-law and compares it to the constitutional review systems of the United States, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Mexico. The study concludes that the two former states correspond to the model, while the latter does not. This is fundamentally due to the role each legal system assigns to ordinary jurisdiction in carrying out constitutional review. Whereas the U.S. and Germany have fostered the policy that constitutional review regarding the enforcement of basic rights is the responsibility of ordinary courts, Mexico has relied too heavily on the specialized constitutional jurisdiction\"--Back cover."},"tableOfContents":"Rule-of-law and judicial federalism : the role of ordinary courts in the enforcement of fundamental rights -- Constitutional review in the United States of America : does \"diffused\" mean complete decentralization? -- The German system of constitutional review : prototype of a concentrated model? -- Constitutional review in Mexico : a best of all worlds solution?","note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"Alfredo Narvez Medcigo."},{"@type":"bibliography","#text":"Includes bibliographical references."}],"subject":[{"geographicCode":[{"@authority":"marcgac","#text":"n-us---"},{"@authority":"marcgac","#text":"e-gw---"},{"@authority":"marcgac","#text":"n-mx---"}]},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Judicial review","geographic":"United States"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Judicial review","geographic":"Germany"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Judicial review","geographic":"Mexico"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Rule of law","geographic":"United States"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Rule of law","geographic":"Germany"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Rule of law","geographic":"Mexico"},{"@authority":"fast","topic":"Rule of law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Comparative government"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Law","Philosophy"]},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Conflict of laws"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Conflict of laws"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"International law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Comparative law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Constitutional law"},{"@authority":"fast","geographic":"Germany"},{"@authority":"fast","geographic":"Mexico"},{"@authority":"fast","geographic":"United States"}],"classification":{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"K3175 .N37 2016"},"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"9783319245614"},{"@type":"isbn","#text":"3319245619"},{"@type":"oclc","#text":"918594210"}],"recordInfo":{"descriptionStandard":"rda","recordContentSource":{"@authority":"marcorg","#text":"YDXCP"},"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"150814"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20170810"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"990146231030203941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)","languageOfCataloging":{"languageTerm":{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"}}},"relatedItem":{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/990146231030203941/catalog"}},"location":[{"url":{"@access":"raw object","#text":"https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:hul.ebookbatch.SPRGR_batch:9783319245621"}},{"physicalLocation":{"@valueURI":"http://isni.org/isni/000000011940971X","@displayLabel":"Harvard repository","@type":"repository","#text":"Harvard Law School Library, Harvard University"},"shelfLocator":"K3175 .N37 2016"}],"extension":{"librarycloud":{"HarvardRepositories":{"HarvardRepository":"Law School"},"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc.prod/990146231030203941","priorrecordids":{"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALEPH","#text":"014623103"}},"processingDate":"2019-01-14T06:15Z"}}},{"titleInfo":{"title":"International law"},"name":{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Klabbers, Jan","role":[{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"creator"}},{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"author."}}]},"typeOfResource":"text","genre":[{"@authority":"marcgt","#text":"bibliography"},{"@authority":"rdacontent","#text":"text"}],"originInfo":[{"place":{"placeTerm":[{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"code","#text":"enk"},{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"text","#text":"England"}]},"dateIssued":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"2017"},"edition":"Second edition.","issuance":"monographic"},{"place":{"placeTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"Cambridge [UK] ;"}},"publisher":"Cambridge University Press,","dateIssued":"2017."}],"language":{"languageTerm":[{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"},{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"text","#text":"English"}]},"physicalDescription":{"form":[{"@authority":"marcform","#text":"print"},{"@type":"media","@authority":"rdamedia","#text":"unmediated"},{"@type":"carrier","@authority":"rdacarrier","#text":"volume"}],"extent":"xxix, 370 pages ; 26 cm"},"abstract":{"@type":"","#text":"\"Written by one of the world's leading international lawyers, this is the new and updated edition of Jan Klabber's landmark textbook.

In arguing that it was an exemplary, rather than aberrant, case of the uses to which law was put in twentieth century industrialised societies, Law and the Making of the Soviet World: The Red Demiurge provides an insightful account of the significance of modern law to the Soviet case and, in turn, the significance of the Soviet case for modern law\"--"}],"tableOfContents":"Introduction: Soviet state and law, Soviet states and law -- Law and the Soviet emergency state I : genesis -- Law and the Soviet emergency state II : development -- Law and the Soviet civil state I : death and resurrection -- Law and the Soviet civil state II : Pashukanis to Vyshinksy -- Law and the Soviet developmental state I : sovereign monopoly capitalism -- Law and the Soviet developmental state II : industrialist, employer, landlord -- Law and the Soviet social state : locating the social in the social state -- Law and the Soviet (multi)cultural state -- Epilogue: Perestroika and collapse of the law : state complexes.","note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"Scott Newton."},{"@type":"bibliography","#text":"Includes bibliographical references (pages 251-263) and index."}],"subject":[{"geographicCode":{"@authority":"marcgac","#text":"e-ur---"}},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Law","geographic":"Soviet Union"}],"classification":[{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"KJC510 .N49 2015"},{"@edition":"23","@authority":"ddc","#text":"349.4709/04"},{"@authority":"bisacsh","#text":"LAW000000 LAW016000 LAW051000"}],"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"9780415726108 (hardback)"},{"@type":"isbn","#text":"0415726107 (hardback)"},{"@type":"isbn","@invalid":"yes","#text":"9781315856131 (ebk.)"},{"@type":"isbn","@invalid":"yes","#text":"1315856131 (ebk.)"},{"@type":"lccn","#text":"^^2014022496"},{"@type":"oclc","#text":"852219606"}],"recordInfo":{"descriptionStandard":"rda","recordContentSource":{"@authority":"marcorg","#text":"DLC"},"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"140609"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20150721"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"990144210120203941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)","languageOfCataloging":{"languageTerm":{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"}}},"relatedItem":{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/990144210120203941/catalog"}},"location":[{"physicalLocation":{"@valueURI":"http://isni.org/isni/000000011940971X","@displayLabel":"Harvard repository","@type":"repository","#text":"Harvard Law School Library, Harvard University"},"shelfLocator":"KJC510 .N49 2015"},"null"],"extension":{"librarycloud":{"HarvardRepositories":{"HarvardRepository":"Law School"},"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc.prod/990144210120203941","priorrecordids":{"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALEPH","#text":"014421012"}},"processingDate":"2019-02-09T06:21Z"}}},{"titleInfo":{"title":"Chance, order, change","subTitle":"the course of international law : general course on public international law"},"name":{"@type":"personal","namePart":["Crawford, James",{"@type":"date","#text":"1948-"}],"role":[{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"creator"}},{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"author."}}]},"typeOfResource":"text","genre":[{"@authority":"marcgt","#text":"bibliography"},{"@authority":"rdacontent","#text":"text"}],"originInfo":[{"place":{"placeTerm":[{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"code","#text":"ne"},{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"text","#text":"Netherlands"}]},"dateIssued":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"2014"},"issuance":"monographic"},{"place":{"placeTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"[The Hague] :"}},"publisher":"AIL-Pocket, Hague Academy of International Law,","dateIssued":"2014."}],"language":{"languageTerm":[{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"},{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"text","#text":"English"}]},"physicalDescription":{"form":[{"@authority":"marcform","#text":"print"},{"@type":"media","@authority":"rdamedia","#text":"unmediated"},{"@type":"carrier","@authority":"rdacarrier","#text":"volume"}],"extent":"537 pages : illustrations, 18 cm."},"abstract":{"@type":"","#text":"The course of international law over time needs to be understood if international law is to be understood.

Now, in this revised edition, Jay M. Feinman offers an updated survey of American law, spiced with new anecdotes and cases, and incorporating fresh material on topics ranging from the President's war powers, to intellectual property, standard form contracts, and eminent domain. Here is an exceptionally clear introduction to law, covering the main subjects found in the first year of law school, giving us a basic understanding of how it all works. Readers are introduced to every aspect of the legal system, from constitutional law and the litigation process to tort law, contract law, property law, and criminal law. Feinman illuminates each discussion with many intriguing, outrageous, and infamous cases, from the scalding coffee case that cost McDonald's half a million dollars, to the sensational murder trial in Victorian London that led to the legal definition of insanity, to the epochal decision in Marbury v. Madison that gave the Supreme Court the power to declare state and federal laws unconstitutional. He broadens the reader's legal vocabulary, clarifying the meaning of everything from \"due process\" and \"equal protection\" in constitutional law, to the distinction between \"murder\" and \"manslaughter\" in criminal law. Perhaps most important, we learn that though the law is voluminous and complex, it is accessible to all. Everyone who wants a better grasp of current legal issues--from students contemplating law school, to journalists covering the legislature or the courts, to fans of Court TV--will find here a wonderful source of information: a complete, clear, and colorful map of the American legal system. - Publisher."},"tableOfContents":"There are no secret books : you can understand the law -- Constitutional law and constitutional politics : interpreting and applying the Constitution -- -- First freedoms : constitutional rights -- Your day in court : the litigation process -- Auto accidents, scalding coffee, and medical malpractice : personal injuries and tort law -- When is a deal a deal? : businesses, consumers, and contract law -- You are what you own : the law of property -- From insanity to in cold blood : criminal responsibility and criminal law -- Protecting the innocent, freeing the guilty : criminal procedure -- Conclusion.","note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"Jay M.

Over recent decades, however, the practical success of investment arbitration has allowed international investment law to develop both its own cadre of academic and professional specialists and its own legal doctrines. However, because of its relative newness as a discipline international investment law is still characterised by the disagreement that accompanies the creation of any new field. As a result of this disagreement, broad consensus is difficult to gain on any topic, as even the strongest arguments reflect a perspective on the discipline that is not universally shared.This book analyses the structure of international investment law, as it has developed through the practice of investment arbitration in order to see how a variety of international investment law doctrines should be understood and applied.

This book analyses the structure of international investment law, as it has developed through the practice of investment arbitration in order to see how a variety of international investment law doctrines should be understood and applied. The book demonstrates how a structural analysis can shed light on several major controversies within investment law and also examines what an investment actually is. The book offers an original interpretative approach to the resolution of problems in international investment law, and so is one of the few books within the field to attempt to give investment law a solid theoretical basis. It also focuses on only a select number of problems, rather than attempting to deliver the universal coverage currently popular for investment law books. As a result, those issues that are addressed get a detailed discussion rarely available in competing texts\"--"}],"tableOfContents":"The meanning of \"investment\" in the ICSID Convention -- The legal impact of notifications under Article 25(4) of the ICSID Convention -- The role of an investment arbitrator and the use of non-binding documents and literature in investment arbitration -- The minimum standard of treatment and the protection of foreign investors during an armed conflict -- The history and development of the most-favoured nation clause -- The operation of the most-favoured nation clause in international investment law -- Dispute resolution procedures and the favourability of treatment under a most-favoured nation clause.","note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"Tony Cole."},{"@type":"bibliography","#text":"Includes bibliographical references."}],"subject":[{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Investments, Foreign (International law)"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"International commercial arbitration"},{"@authority":"bisacsh","topic":"BUSINESS & ECONOMICS / International / Economics"},{"@authority":"bisacsh","topic":"LAW / General"},{"@authority":"bisacsh","topic":"LAW / Arbitration, Negotiation, Mediation"}],"classification":[{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"K3830 .C65 2013"},{"@edition":"23","@authority":"ddc","#text":"346/.092"},{"@authority":"bisacsh","#text":"BUS069020 LAW000000 LAW006000"}],"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"9780415579858 (hbk)"},{"@type":"isbn","@invalid":"yes","#text":"9780203758755 (ebk)"},{"@type":"lccn","#text":"^^2012051250"},{"@type":"oclc","#text":"822972395"}],"relatedItem":{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/990137989330203941/catalog"}},"location":[{"physicalLocation":{"@valueURI":"http://isni.org/isni/000000011940971X","@displayLabel":"Harvard repository","@type":"repository","#text":"Harvard Law School Library, Harvard University"},"shelfLocator":"K3830 .C65 2013"},"null","null"],"extension":[{"sets":"null"},{"librarycloud":{"HarvardRepositories":{"HarvardRepository":"Law School"},"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc.prod/990137989330203941","priorrecordids":{"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALEPH","#text":"013798933"}},"processingDate":"2018-11-30T01:35Z"}}],"recordInfo":{"descriptionStandard":"rda","recordContentSource":{"@authority":"marcorg","#text":"DLC"},"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"121221"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20130919"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"990137989330203941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)","languageOfCataloging":{"languageTerm":{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"}}}},{"titleInfo":{"title":"International law in domestic courts","subTitle":"a casebook"},"name":[{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Nollkaemper, Andre","role":{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"editor."}}},{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Reinisch, August","role":{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"editor."}}},{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Janik, Ralph","role":{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"editor."}}},{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Simlinger, Florentina","role":{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"editor."}}}],"typeOfResource":"text","genre":[{"@authority":"marcgt","#text":"bibliography"},{"@authority":"rdacontent","#text":"text"},{"@authority":"fast","#text":"Casebooks (Law)"},{"@authority":"lcgft","#text":"Casebooks (Law)"},{"@authority":"fast","#text":"Trials, litigation, etc."}],"originInfo":[{"place":{"placeTerm":[{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"code","#text":"enk"},{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"text","#text":"England"}]},"dateIssued":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"2018"},"edition":"First edition.","issuance":"monographic"},{"place":{"placeTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"Oxford, United Kingdom ;"}},"publisher":"Oxford University Press,","dateIssued":"2018."}],"language":{"languageTerm":[{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"},{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"text","#text":"English"}]},"physicalDescription":{"form":[{"@authority":"marcform","#text":"print"},{"@type":"media","@authority":"rdamedia","#text":"unmediated"},{"@type":"carrier","@authority":"rdacarrier","#text":"volume"}],"extent":"lii, 705 pages ; 25 cm"},"abstract":{"@type":"","#text":"The application of international law by domestic courts has gained increasing attention in recent years. In an ever-more interconnected world, domestic courts now make reference to judgments by foreign courts when faced with similar or identical legal problems involving international law. Their judgments see increasing recognition of their pivotal role in shaping and interpreting international law. Understanding them will be of use for any practitioner and scholar in international law. 0International Law in Domestic Courts, Oxford's online collection of domestic court decisions which apply international law, has been providing scholars with at-your-fingertips access to analysis and commentary for more than a decade. First established in 2006, it now includes over 1,700 judgments of cases involving international law-related aspects from nearly 100 countries and continues to expand. This Casebook is the perfect companion, presenting a selection of the most important cases along with a commentary to give a holistic overview of the use of international law in national courts, and how the jurisprudence has developed international law itself. Practitioners, students, and academics will find this an invaluable resource when faced with the complex questions of applying international law in domestic courts."},"note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"edited by Andre Nollkaemper, August Reinisch ; with Ralph Janik, Florentina Simlinger."},{"@type":"bibliography","#text":"Includes bibliographical references."}],"subject":[{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"International law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"International law","genre":"Cases"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Conflict of laws"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Conflict of laws","genre":"Cases"},{"@authority":"fast","topic":"Conflict of laws"},{"@authority":"fast","topic":"International law"},{"topic":["nemzetkozi jog","jogesetek"]}],"classification":[{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"KZ1293 .I58 2018"},{"@edition":"23","@authority":"ddc","#text":"341"},{"@edition":"23","@authority":"ddc","#text":"340.9"},{"@authority":"bcl","#text":"86.80"}],"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"0198739745"},{"@type":"isbn","#text":"9780198739746"},{"@type":"isbn","#text":"9780198739753"},{"@type":"isbn","#text":"0198739753"},{"@type":"lccn","#text":"2018952553"},{"@type":"oclc","#text":"1035437219"}],"recordInfo":{"descriptionStandard":"rda","recordContentSource":{"@authority":"marcorg","#text":"YDX"},"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"180716"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20190114"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"99153739018103941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)","languageOfCataloging":{"languageTerm":{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"}}},"relatedItem":{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/99153739018103941/catalog"}},"location":[{"physicalLocation":{"@valueURI":"http://isni.org/isni/000000011940971X","@displayLabel":"Harvard repository","@type":"repository","#text":"Harvard Law School Library, Harvard University"},"shelfLocator":"KZ1293 .I58 2018"},"null"],"extension":{"librarycloud":{"HarvardRepositories":{"HarvardRepository":"Law School"},"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc.prod/99153739018103941","processingDate":"2019-01-18T10:01Z"}}},{"titleInfo":{"title":"Issues in international law and military operations"},"name":{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Jaques, Richard."},"typeOfResource":"text","genre":[{"@authority":"marcgt","#text":"bibliography"},"text",{"@authority":"marcgt","#text":"Electronic books"}],"originInfo":{"place":[{"placeTerm":[{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"code","#text":"riu"},{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"text","#text":"Rhode Island"}]},{"placeTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"Newport, RI"}}],"publisher":"Naval War College","dateIssued":"2006","issuance":"monographic"},"language":{"languageTerm":[{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"},{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"text","#text":"English"}]},"physicalDescription":{"form":[{"@authority":"gmd","#text":"electronic resource"},{"@type":"media","@authority":"","#text":"computer"},{"@type":"carrier","@authority":"","#text":"online resource"}],"extent":"1 online resource (xv, 378 p. )"},"tableOfContents":"Iraq's transformation and international law -- Iraq and the law of armed conflict -- International law and the 2003 campaign against Iraq -- Jus in Bello issues arising in the hostilities in Iraq in 2003 -- Query : is there a status of unlawful combatant? -- Special forces wear of non-standard uniforms -- Strategic targeting and international law : the ambiguity of law meets the reality of a single-superpower world -- Air power, accuracy, and the law of targeting : why no brave new world? -- Targeting and humanitarian law : current issues -- Coalition operations and the law -- Current legal issues in maritime operations : maritime interception operations in the global war on terrorism, exclusion zones, hospital ships, and maritime neutrality -- The legal efficacy of freedom of navigation assertions -- Military activities in the exclusive economic zone : preventing uncertainty and defusing conflict -- The unique and protected status of hospital ships under the law of armed conflict -- Legal and tactical dilemmas inherent in fighting terror : experience of the Israeli army in Jenin and Bethlehem (April/May 2002) -- International humanitarian law : should it be reaffirmed, clarified or developed? -- Enforcing the law -- Protection of cultural property : the legal aspects -- The law of armed conflict and the war on terrorism -- Interoperability and the Atlantic divide : a bridge over troubled waters.","note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"Richard B.

The collection provides valuable insights into the compatibility of the Islamic law of war and peace and the law of armed conflict, demonstrating how the former could minimise unnecessary human suffering during armed conflict.

The Code was first published in 1926, and a new edition of the code has been published every six years since 1934. The 2006 edition of the Code incorporates laws enacted through the One Hundred Ninth Congress, Second session, the last of which was signed by the President on January 15, 2007. It does not include laws of the One Hundred Tenth Congress, First session, enacted between January 4, 2007, the date it convened, and January 15, 2007. By statutory authority this edition may be cited \"USC 2006 ed.\" As adopted in 1926, the Code established prima facie the general and permanent laws of the United States. The underlying statutes reprinted in the Code remained in effect and controlled over the Code in case of any discrepancy. In 1947, Congress began enacting individual titles of the Code into positive law. When a title is enacted into positive law, the underlying statutes are repealed and the title then becomes legal evidence of the law. Currently, 24 of the 50 titles in the Code have been so enacted. These are identified in the table of titles near the beginning of each volume. The Law Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives continues to prepare legislation pursuant to 2 USC 285b to enact the remainder of the Code, on a title-by-title basis, into positive law. The 2006 edition of the Code was prepared and published under the supervision of Peter G LeFevre, Law Revision Counsel; Grateful acknowledgment is made of the contributions by all who helped in this work, particularly the staffs of the Office of the Law Revision Counsel and the Government Printing Office. -- Nancy Pelosi."},"tableOfContents":"v-1: Organic laws -- Title 1 -- General provisions to -- Title 5: Government organization and employees, [sections] 101-5949 -- v-2: Title 5 -- Government organization and employees, [sections] 6101-End to -- Title 7 -- Agriculture, [sections] 1-855 -- v-3: Title 7-- Agriculture, [sections] 701-End -- [sections] 901-End -- v-4: Title 8 -- Aliens and nationalty to Title 10 -- Armed forces [sections] 1001-1805 -- Title 8: -- Aliens and nationality to Title 10: -- Armed forces [section 101-1414] -- v-5: Title 10 -- Armed forces [sections] 2001-End -- v-6: Title 11 -- Bankruptcy to Title 12 -- Banks and banking [sections] 1-1750jj -- v-7: Title 12 -- Banks and banking [sections]1751-End to -- Title 15 -- Commerce and trade [sections] 1-79z-6 -- v-8: Title 15 -- Commerce and trade [sections] 80a-1-End -- v-9: Title 16 -- Conservation [sections] 1-785 -- v-10: Title 16 -- Conservation [sections]791-End to Title 17 -- Copyrights -- v-11: T itle 18 -- Crimes and criminal procedure to -- Title 19 -- Customs duties [sections] 1-168 1b -- v-12: Title 19 -- Customs duties [sections] 1701-End to -- Title 20 -- Education [sections] 1-1482 -- v-13: Title 20 -- Education [section] 1501-End to -- Title 21-- Food and drugs -- v-14: Title 22 -- Foreign relations and intercourse [sections] 1-5732 -- v-15: Title 22 -- Foreign relations and intercourse -[sections] 5801-End to -- Title 25 -- Indians -- v-16: Title 26 -- Internal revenue code [sections] 1-565 -- v-17: Title 26 -- Internal revenue code [sections] 581-5981 -- v-18: Title 26 -- Internal revenue code [sections] 6001-End to -- Title 28 -- Judiciary and judicial procedure -- v-19: Title 28 -- Judiciary and judicial procedure appendix to -- Title 30 -- Mineral lands and mining -- v-20: Title 31 -- Money and finance to -- Title 35 -- Patents -- v-21: Title 36 -- Patriotic and national observances, ceremonies, and organizations to -- Title 38 -- Veterans' benefits -- v-22: Title 39 -- Postal service to Title 42 -- Public Health and welfare [sections] 1-295p -- v-23: Title 42 -- Public Health and welfare [sections] 296-1394 -- v-24: Title 42 -- Public Health and welfare [sections] 1395-1440 -- v-25: Title 42 -- Public Health and welfare [sections] 1441-4395 -- v-26: Title 42 -- Public Health and welfare [sections] 4401-8146 -- v-27: Title 42 -- Public Health and welfare [sections] 8201-End -- v-28: Title 43 -- Public lands to Title 46 -- Shipping -- v-29: Title 47: -- Telegraphs, telephones, and radiotelegraphs to Title 40: -- Transportation [sections] 101-33118 -- v-30: Title 49 -- Transportation [sections] 40101-End to Title 50 -- War and national defense -- v-31: Title -- Popular names and tables: revised titles, revised Statutes 1878, and Statutes at Large (1789-1970) -- v-32: Tables: Statutes at Large (1971-1994) -- v-33: Statutes at Large (1971-2006), Executive orders, proclamations, and reorganization Plans: General Index A -- v-34: General Index B-G -- v-35: General Index H-Q -- v-36 General Index R-Z -- Supplement 1 -- Supplement 2 v-1: Title 1-- General provisions to Title 14 -- Coast guard -- Supplement 2 v-2: Title 15 -- Commerce and trade to Title 27 -- Intoxicating liquors Supplement 2 v-3: Title 28 -- Judiciary and judicial procedure to Title 42 -- the Public health and welfare -- Supplement 2 v-4: Title 43 -- Pubic lands to Title 50 -- War and national defense Popular names, tables and index -- Supplement 3 v-3: -- Title 22 Foreign relations and intercourse to -- Title 42 -- Public health and welfare -- Supplement 4 v-1: -- Title 1: General provisions to Title 10: Armed forces -- Title 11: -- Bankruptcy to Title 16: -- Conservation -- Supplement 4 v-4: Title 17: -- Copyrights -- Title 25: -- Indians Supplement 4 v-4: -- Title 26: -- Internal revenue code -- Title 41: -- Public lands -- Supplement 4 -- v 5 -- Title 42: -- Public Health and Welfare -- Supplement 4 -- v 6 -- Title 42: -- Public health and welfare -- Title 51 -- National and commercial space programs -- Supplement 4 v 7 -- Popular names, tables, and index -- Supplement 5 v 2 -- Bankruptcy to Commerce and Trade -- Supplement 5 v 3 -- Title 16 -

The development and introduction of abortion, organ donation, gender reassignment, and non-therapeutic cosmetic surgery have, for example, all raised ethical, legal, and clinical issues. This book examines the various factors that legitimatise a medical procedure. Bringing together a range of internationally and nationally recognised academics from law, philosophy, medicine, health, economics, and sociology, the book explores the notion of a treatment, practice, or procedure being proper medical treatment, and considers the range of diverse factors which might influence the acceptance of a particular procedure as appropriate in the medical context. Contributors address such issues as clinical judgement and professional autonomy, the role of public interest, and the influence of resource allocation in decision-making. In doing so, the book explores how the law, the medical profession, and the public interact in determining whether a new or ethically contentious procedure should be regarded as legitimate. This book will be of interest and use to researchers and students of bioethics, medical law, criminal law, and the sociology of medicine."},"tableOfContents":["1.

The authors explore how European values, tradition and new legal challenges interconnect and dictate the paths of transition between old and new Europe. The first chapter starts with a question: can Roman Legal Tradition play a role of identity factor towards a New Europe? Can it be considered as a general value identifying new Europe, built on a minimum core of principles  persona, dominum, obligation, contract and inheritance  composing the whole European private law tradition? Subsequent chapters attempt to provide possible responses to the question: what is Europe today? The answers diverge, depending on the research area. The inherent dichotomy of human rights protection in Europe and the concept of one law, one court are investigated in the second chapter, whereas the third chapter focuses on asylum and the interrelation and interdependence of the Court of Justice of the EU and the European Court of Human Rights. The next three chapters concentrate on matters of equal treatment and non-discrimination. The first contribution in this part reflects on the crisis and methodological and conceptual issues faced by modern anti-discrimination law. It is followed by a specific analysis of the empowerment of women or gender-balancing in company boards. The third contribution reveals the impact of the Croatian anti-discrimination law on private law relations. The next chapter deals with the issue of social rights in Croatia and the method of their regulation in the context of the new European values. The immense challenges posed by the market integration imperative and democratic transition have brought about different reactions in the national legal systems and legal cultures of both old and new Member States. As such, Europe has effectively been reunited, but what about the convergence of national legal cultures? This is the focal point of the remaining chapters, which focus on various issues, from internal market, competition law, consumer welfare, liberalization of network industries to the EU capital market. The magnitude of EU activity in these areas offers conclusive evidence that old and new paradigms are evolving and shaping the future of the EU.."},"tableOfContents":"New Europe-Old Values?

It illustrates how the gradual application of EU economic law to HEIs which were predominantly identified as being within the public sector creates tensions between the economic and the social spheres in the EU. Given the reluctance of the Member States to openly develop an EU level HEI policy, these tensions appear as unintended consequences of the traditional application of the EU Treaty provisions in areas such as Union Citizenship, the free movement provisions and competition policy to the HEI sector. These developments may endanger the traditional non-economic mission of European HEIs. In this respect, the effects of Union Citizenship and free movement law on HEIs have received some attention but the impact of EU competition law constitutes a largely unexplored area of research and this book redresses that imbalance. The aim of the research is to show that intended and unintended consequences of the EU economic constitution(s) are enhanced by a parallel tendency of Member States to commercialise formerly public sectors such as the HEI sector. The book investigates the potential tensions through doctrinal analysis and a qualitative study focussing on the exposure of HEI research to EU competition law as an under-researched example of exposure to economic constraints. It concludes that such exposure may compromise the wider aims that research intensive universities pursue in the public interest.

This is the economy of the twenty-first century, characterized by ever-expanding global supply chains and communication systems. In 2005, Thomas Friedman reduced this phenomenon to one phrase, the title of his massively successful book: The World is Flat. Of course, the phrase is misleading.

Hadfield argues that not only are these systems too slow, costly, and localized to support economic complexity, they also fail to address looming challenges such as global warming, poverty, and oppression in developing countries. The answer, however, is not the one critics usually reach for-to have less of it.

On the one hand, the discourse on multilevel governance draws attention to the possibility that problems may arise if interdependent actors do not sufficiently interact.

The book accordingly develops a normative framework to determine the extent to which private actors should be able to develop binding rules, based on principles of democracy, private autonomy, and concerns for hetero-determination.

It is written by two authors who represent both the new world (Australia) and the old world (Germany).The authorspresent their research in the global business context, with legal and regulatory perspectives including some references from Africa, Asia, the Middle East and South America. After every boom and bust, legislators pass new disclosure legislation, often in a heated environment fuelled by politics and the media. Little regard is paid to existing regulation or the lessons learned fromearlier regulation. The result is the continuing enactment of redundant and overlapping disclosure laws. Since financial markets are often described as markets for information, the failure to ensure disclosure is at the heart of financial services regulation. This book argues that the solution to the failure of disclosure is a brief, easily understood, principles-based, plain English safety-net amendment to statute law such as you must keep the financial market fully informed, a measure that would support effective mandatory continuous disclosure of information to financial markets. This book examines the reasons for disclosure regulation, and how the efficient operation of financial markets is dependent on disclosure. It examines the adequacy of common law and civil law concerning broker/client disclosure, and concludes that industry licensing in itself fails to keep the market informed. While recognizing the failures of securities commissions to achieve good disclosure in financial markets, it confirms the effectiveness of coregulation of disclosure by a commission with the support of thefinancial markets (such as the stock exchange). Coregulation builds on financial market self-regulation, and is best described in the words of one-time SEC Chairman William O. Douglas, who, in the 1930s, described it as a shotgun behind the door.."},"tableOfContents":"Chapter 1: Introduction  Promoting Information -- Chapter 2: Disclosure of Financial and Non-Financial Information in the Marketplace -- Chapter 3: How Should Financial Markets Be Regulated to Ensure That Information is Provided? -- Chapter 4: Promoting Information Under Broker/Client Rules at Common Law and in Equity -- Chapter 5: The Failure of Industry Licensing to Keep the Market Informed  Obligation to Provide Financial Services Efficiently, Honestly and Fairly -- Chapter 6: The Ability of the Commission to Achieve Disclosure in Financial Markets -- Chapter 7: Stock Exchanges and the Promotion of Information -- Chapter 8: Towards Principles-Based Regulation.","note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"by Paul Latimer, Philipp Maume."},"Description based upon print version of record.",{"@type":"bibliography","#text":"Includes bibliographical references at the end of each chapters and index."},{"@type":"language","#text":"English"}],"subject":[{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Finance"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Commercial law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Private international law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Conflict of laws"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"International law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Comparative law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Trade"},{"topic":"Law"},{"topic":"International Economic Law, Trade Law"},{"topic":"Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law"},{"topic":"Finance, general"},{"topic":"Commercial Law"}],"classification":[{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"K3820-3836"},{"@authority":"ddc","#text":"343/.03 657.8333"}],"relatedItem":["null",{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/99153646212703941/catalog"}}],"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"3-319-09459-9"},{"@type":"doi","#text":"10.1007/978-3-319-09459-5"},{"@type":"oclc","#text":"895661103"}],"recordInfo":{"descriptionStandard":"rda","recordContentSource":{"@authority":"marcorg","#text":"MiAaPQ"},"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"141114"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20170821"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"99153646212703941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)","languageOfCataloging":{"languageTerm":{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"}}},"extension":{"librarycloud":{"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc.prod/99153646212703941","processingDate":"2018-11-30T16:20Z"}},"location":"null"},{"titleInfo":{"title":"Corporate law and financial instability"},"name":{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Kokkinis, Andreas","role":[{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"creator"}},{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"author."}}]},"typeOfResource":"text","genre":[{"@authority":"marcgt","#text":"bibliography"},{"@authority":"rdacontent","#text":"text"}],"originInfo":[{"place":{"placeTerm":[{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"code","#text":"enk"},{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"text","#text":"England"}]},"dateIssued":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"2018"},"issuance":"monographic"},{"place":{"placeTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"Abingdon, Oxon ;"}},"publisher":"Routledge, an imprint of the Taylor & Francis Group,","dateIssued":"2018."}],"language":{"languageTerm":[{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"},{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"text","#text":"English"}]},"physicalDescription":{"form":[{"@authority":"marcform","#text":"print"},{"@type":"media","@authority":"rdamedia","#text":"unmediated"},{"@type":"carrier","@authority":"rdacarrier","#text":"volume"}],"extent":"xx, 223 pages ; 25 cm."},"abstract":{"@type":"Summary","#text":"Virtually all large banks and other financial institutions in the UK and internationally are public limited liability companies whose shares are listed on one or several stock exchanges. As such, their corporate governance and, in particular, the incentives faced by their directors and senior managers are to a significant extent determined by corporate and securities law rules such as directors' duties, directors' liability in insolvency, takeover regulation, disclosure obligations, shareholder rights and rules on executive remuneration. At the same time, systemically important financial institutions in the UK are licensed, regulated and supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). This book explores the relationship between, on the one hand, the broader corporate law, corporate governance and securities law framework and, on the other, the prudential regulatory framework. Although the book's main focus is on UK law, much of the policy argumentation is relevant globally and therefore appropriate international comparisons are drawn, and analysis of EU law and regulation is included. The book argues that the corporate law regime, which focuses on shareholder empowerment and profit maximisation, operates as an antithesis to prudential regulatory objectives thus undermining the safety and soundness of banks and other financial institutions by encouraging risky behaviour that may be in the best interests of their shareholders, but is clearly not in the public interest."},"tableOfContents":"Shareholder power as a major cause of excessive risk-taking In banks and other financial institutions -- The UK corporate law and governance framework as a mechanism to

detailed legal and policy analysis of the institutions that safeguard monetary stability and financial stability nationally, at the EU level and globally. The new edition has been renamed (previously 'Legal Foundations of International Monetary Stability') to better reflect the book's breadth of coverage, which includes an in-depth study of central banking, a fresh look at supervision, regulation and crisis management after the global financial crisis. It also includes updated material on the law of the European Central Bank and banking union, the law of the IMF and work undertaken by international standard-setters, in particular the FSB and the Basel Committee. Part I focuses on national developments, Part II deals with EU developments and Part III examines international developments. Each of these sections commences with a historical chapter, then analyses the framework of the 'monetary architecture'. Finally, each part considers the 'financial architecture' with regard to the functions of financial supervision (micro and macro) and surveillance, regulation and crisis management, including lender of last resort and resolution.\"--"},"tableOfContents":"I.

Law does not exist in a vacuum, and an appreciation of the social, cultural and other factors affecting it may often be helpful for a sounder understanding of its nature and significance, especially when law is considered in a broader, comparative, context. Insights drawn from other disciplines may therefore be especially appropriate for comparative legal studies, but the use of those insights raises various questions, suchs as the manner in which other disciplines--given their own distinctive concerns and modes of analysis--characterise the nature and significance of law and legal institutions. Interdisciplinary study also encourages us to ask how cognate disciplines and their arguments are seen, used and maltreated in comparative legal studies, as well as the pitfalls which await scholars from other disciplines who venture into law. The essays in this collection offer a unique contribution to these and other aspects of the use of interdisciplinarity in comparative law\"--Back cover."},"tableOfContents":"Introduction / Nicholas HD Foster, Maria Federica Moscati, and Michael Palmer -- Literary model in comparative law : Shakespeare, Corneille, Racine / Eric Heinze -- Interdisciplinary comparative law - between Scylla and Charybdis? / Jaakko Husa -- Leximetric approach to comparative corporate governance : the case of hedge fund activism / Dionysia Katelouzou -- Translating ambiguity / Karen McAuliffe -- Comparison in the anthropology and history of law / Fernanda Pirie -- View from the coal face : interdisciplinary influences on family mediation in the United Kingdom / Marian Roberts -- 'Listing concentrates the mind' : the English Civil Court as an arena for structured negotiation / Simon Roberts -- Review of Simon Roberts' last book : A Court in the City: Civil and Commercial Litigation at the Beginning of the 21st Century / Ross Cranston -- Bringing in foreign ideas : the quest for 'better law' in implicity comparative law / Mathias Siems -- Comparative law and economics and the 'egg-laying wool-milk sow' / Florian Wagner-von Papp -- Poverty of economics and the hope for humanities in comparative law / Gary Watt.","note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"edited by Nicholas HD Foster, Maria Federica Moscati and Michael Palmer."},{"@type":"bibliography","#text":"Includes bibliographical references and index."}],"subject":[{"@authority":"lcsh","name":{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Roberts, Simon (Simon A.)"}},{"@authority":"gnd","topic":"Rechtsvergleich"},{"@authority":"gnd","topic":"Recht"},{"@authority":"gnd","topic":"Interdisziplinaritt"},{"@authority":"gnd","topic":"Gesellschaft"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Comparative law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Law and the social sciences"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Law","Study and teaching"]},{"@authority":"fast","topic":"Law and the social sciences"},{"@authority":"fast","topic":["Law","Study and teaching"]},{"@authority":"fast","topic":"Comparative law"}],"classification":[{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"K487.S6 I58 2016"},{"@edition":"23","@authority":"ddc","#text":"340/.115"}],"relatedItem":[{"titleInfo":{"title":"JCL studies in comparative law ; no. 15"}},{"@type":"series","titleInfo":{"title":"JCL studies in comparative law ; no. 15"}},{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/990149283030203941/catalog"}}],"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"9780854902101"},{"@type":"isbn","#text":"0854902104"},{"@type":"oclc","#text":"960642915"}],"recordInfo":{"descriptionStandard":"rda","recordContentSource":{"@authority":"marcorg","#text":"DU0"},"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"160929"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20170908"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"990149283030203941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)","languageOfCataloging":{"languageTerm":{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"}}},"location":[{"physicalLocation":{"@valueURI":"http://isni.org/isni/000000011940971X","@displayLabel":"Harvard repository","@type":"repository","#text":"Harvard Law School Library, Harvard University"},"shelfLocator":"K487.S6 I58 2016"},"null"],"extension":{"librarycloud":{"HarvardRepositories":{"HarvardRepository":"Law School"},"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc.prod/990149283030203941","priorrecordids":{"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALEPH","#text":"014928303"}},"processingDate":"2019-02-10T06:22Z"}}},{"titleInfo":[{"nonSort":"The  ","title":"Law journal"},{"@type":"uniform","title":"Law journal (London, England : 1866)"}],"typeOfResource":"text","genre":{"@authority":"marcgt","#text":"periodical"},"originInfo":{"place":[{"placeTerm":[{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"code","#text":"enk"},{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"text","#text":"England"}]},{"placeTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"London"}}],"publisher":"E.B.

The starting hypothesis is that the European Court of Justice has developed concepts in private law cases which are different in substance from the concepts which exist in the private law systems of the Member States. The project aims to present developments in present law of which EU lawyers and private lawyers generally are unaware. It envisions to give ground-breaking analyses of private law concepts (the person, property, contract and tort and remedies) which are used, created or adjusted by the Court. Each analysis results from obtaining insights in the substantive meaning of the conceptual subjects addressed in the Court's case law, disconnected from national meanings of such concepts. The direction of this analysis is from the cases to the concepts, not the other way around: the cases and the facts behind the cases are the starting point. The analyses try to avoid preconceptions based on national private law systems."},"tableOfContents":"Primary EU law and private law concepts /Hans-W.

In a half dozen years during the 1990s, the law school radically transformed itself. It separated from its parent, adopted a new name, became the first for-profit law school to gain ABA accreditation, and converted to a nonprofit. Admissions applications soared tenfold resulting in a nationally based student body second in California only to Stanford's for geographic diversity, the academic dismissal rate dropped below 10 percent and its California bar pass rate climbed above 75 percent. Graduates received offers from prestigious law firms in New York, Los Angeles and other cities. The law school was ranked 5th in the nation for the quality of academic life and 55th worldwide for the number of its faculty publications downloaded by scholars and practitioners.

Taking as its starting point the debates and mutual misunderstandings between proponents of different philosophical traditions, it argues that this theoretical pluralism is better explained once law is accepted as an essentially ambiguous concept. Continuing on, the book develops a robust theory of law that increases our grasp on global legal pluralism and the dynamics of law. This theory of legal interactionism, inspired by the work of Lon Fuller and Philip Selznick, also helps us to understand apparent anomalies of modern law, such as international law, the law of the European Convention on Human Rights and horizontal interactive legislation. In an ecumenical approach, legal interactionism does justice to the valuable core of truth in natural law and legal positivism.--"},"tableOfContents":"Two basic models of law and morality -- Essentially ambiguous concepts -- The debate between Fuller, Hart, and Dworkin -- The relations between law and morality -- A pluralist framework -- What is Legal Interactionism? -- Understanding the dynamics of law -- Three apparent anomalies in modern law -- The necessary and contingent relationship between law and morality.","note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"Wibren van der Burg, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands."},{"@type":"bibliography","#text":"Includes bibliographical references (pages 171-180) and index."}],"subject":[{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Law","Moral and ethical aspects"]},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Law and ethics"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Legal polycentricity"},{"topic":"Law / Moral and ethical aspects"},{"topic":"Law and ethics"},{"topic":"Legal polycentricity"},{"@authority":"gnd","topic":"Gesetzeskonkurrenz"},{"@authority":"gnd","topic":"Rechtsethik"},{"@authority":"fast","topic":"Law and ethics"},{"@authority":"fast","topic":["Law","Moral and ethical aspects"]},{"@authority":"fast","topic":"Legal polycentricity"}],"classification":[{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"K247.6 .B87 2014"},{"@edition":"23","@authority":"ddc","#text":"340/.112"}],"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"9781472430403 (hardback)"},{"@type":"isbn","#text":"1472430409 (hardback)"},{"@type":"isbn","@invalid":"yes","#text":"9781472430410 (ebook)"},{"@type":"isbn","@invalid":"yes","#text":"1472430417 (ebook)"},{"@type":"isbn","@invalid":"yes","#text":"9781472430427 (epub)"},{"@type":"isbn","@invalid":"yes","#text":"1472430425 (epub)"},{"@type":"lccn","#text":"^^2013039372"},{"@type":"oclc","#text":"859168764"}],"recordInfo":{"descriptionStandard":"rda","recordContentSource":{"@authority":"marcorg","#text":"DLC"},"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"130927"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20141024"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"990141676370203941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)","languageOfCataloging":{"languageTerm":{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"}}},"relatedItem":{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/990141676370203941/catalog"}},"location":[{"physicalLocation":{"@valueURI":"http://isni.org/isni/000000011940971X","@displayLabel":"Harvard repository","@type":"repository","#text":"Harvard Law School Library, Harvard University"},"shelfLocator":"K247.6 .B87 2014"},"null"],"extension":{"librarycloud":{"HarvardRepositories":{"HarvardRepository":"Law School"},"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc.prod/990141676370203941","priorrecordids":{"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALEPH","#text":"014167637"}},"processingDate":"2018-11-30T08:43Z"}}},{"titleInfo":{"title":"European private law","subTitle":"current status and perspectives"},"name":[{"@type":"conference","namePart":"European Law Days (3rd : 2010 : Mnster in Westfalen, Germany)","role":{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"creator"}}},{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Schulte-Nlke, Hans."},{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Schulze, Reiner."},{"@type":"corporate","namePart":["Universitt Mnster","Centrum fr Europisches Privatrecht."]},{"@type":"corporate","namePart":["Universitt Osnabrck","European Legal Studies Institute."]}],"typeOfResource":"text","genre":[{"@authority":"marcgt","#text":"bibliography"},{"@authority":"marcgt","#text":"conference publication"},{"@authority":"fast","#text":"Conference papers and proceedings"},{"@authority":"lcgft","#text":"Electronic books."},{"@authority":"fast","#text":"Conference papers and proceedings."},{"@authority":"fast","#text":"Conference papers and proceedings."}],"originInfo":{"place":[{"placeTerm":[{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"code","#text":"gw"},{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"text","#text":"Germany"}]},{"placeTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"Munich"}}],"publisher":"Sellier, European Law Publishers","dateIssued":["c2011",{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"2011"}],"issuance":"monographic"},"language":[{"languageTerm":[{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"},{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"text","#text":"English"}]},{"languageTerm":{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"fre"}},{"languageTerm":{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"ger"}}],"physicalDescription":{"form":{"@authority":"marcform","#text":"print"},"extent":"1 online resource (x, 278 p.)"},"abstract":{"@type":"Summary","#text":"Business law and labour law are driving forces and core areas of European private law.

It is written by two authors who represent both the new world (Australia) and the old world (Germany).The authorspresent their research in the global business context, with legal and regulatory perspectives including some references from Africa, Asia, the Middle East and South America. After every boom and bust, legislators pass new disclosure legislation, often in a heated environment fuelled by politics and the media. Little regard is paid to existing regulation or the lessons learned fromearlier regulation. The result is the continuing enactment of redundant and overlapping disclosure laws. Since financial markets are often described as markets for information, the failure to ensure disclosure is at the heart of financial services regulation.^ This book argues that the solution to the failure of disclosure is a brief, easily understood, principles-based, plain English safety-net amendment to statute law such as you must keep the financial market fully informed, a measure that would support effective mandatory continuous disclosure of information to financial markets. This book examines the reasons for disclosure regulation, and how the efficient operation of financial markets is dependent on disclosure. It examines the adequacy of common law and civil law concerning broker/client disclosure, and concludes that industry licensing in itself fails to keep the market informed. While recognizing the failures of securities commissions to achieve good disclosure in financial markets, it confirms the effectiveness of coregulation of disclosure by a commission with the support of thefinancial markets (such as the stock exchange).^ Coregulation builds on financial market self-regulation, and is best described in the words of one-time SEC Chairman William O. Douglas, who, in the 1930s, described it as a shotgun behind the door."},"tableOfContents":"Chapter 1: Introduction  Promoting Information -- Chapter 2: Disclosure of Financial and Non-Financial Information in the Marketplace -- Chapter 3: How Should Financial Markets Be Regulated to Ensure That Information is Provided? -- Chapter 4: Promoting Information Under Broker/Client Rules at Common Law and in Equity -- Chapter 5: The Failure of Industry Licensing to Keep the Market Informed  Obligation to Provide Financial Services Efficiently, Honestly and Fairly -- Chapter 6: The Ability of the Commission to Achieve Disclosure in Financial Markets -- Chapter 7: Stock Exchanges and the Promotion of Information -- Chapter 8: Towards Principles-Based Regulation.","note":{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"by Paul Latimer, Philipp Maume."},"subject":[{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Commercial law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Commercial law"},{"topic":"International Economic Law, Trade Law"},{"topic":"Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law"},{"topic":"Finance/Investment/Banking"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Finance"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Conflict of laws"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Conflict of laws"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"International law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Comparative law"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Trade"}],"classification":[{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"K3820-3836"},{"@edition":"23","@authority":"ddc","#text":"343.07"}],"relatedItem":[{"@type":"otherFormat","@displayLabel":"Printed edition:","@otherType":"Printed edition:"},{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/990142720670203941/catalog"}}],"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"9783319094595"},{"@type":"isbn","#text":"9783319094595"},{"@type":"isbn","#text":"9783319094588"},{"@type":"doi","#text":"10.1007/978-3-319-09459-5"}],"recordInfo":{"descriptionStandard":"aacr","recordContentSource":{"@authority":"marcorg","#text":"Springer"},"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"141114"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20180405"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"990142720670203941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)"},"location":{"url":{"@access":"raw object","#text":"https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:hul.ebookbatch.SPRGR_batch:201804059783319094595"}},"extension":{"librarycloud":{"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc.prod/990142720670203941","priorrecordids":{"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALEPH","#text":"014272067"}},"processingDate":"2018-11-30T00:55Z"}}},{"titleInfo":[{"title":"Elgar encyclopedia of comparative law"},{"@type":"alternative","title":"Encyclopedia of comparative law"}],"name":[{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Smits, J.

In addition, it analyzes the question of how innovation can best be transformed into IPR, and how IPR can best be exploited to encourage innovation. Comparing and contrasting these two giant nations can be highly beneficial as China and India were the two fastest-growing economies in the last three decades, and together their populations make up one third of the worlds total population; as such, exploring how to sustain their growth via innovation and commercialization of IPR could have a tremendous positive impact on global well-being. While a study of these two mega countries with such diverse dimensions and magnitudes can never be truly comprehensive, this joint effort by scholars from law, business management and economics disciplines that pursues an empirical approach makes a valuable contribution. Divided into three parts, the first offers an in-depth doctrinal and empirical analysis. The second part exclusively focuses on India, while the last is dedicated to China."},"tableOfContents":"Introduction -- Do IPRS Promote Innovation? -- Technology and Business Innovation: Role and Value Measurement of IPRs -- Does Patent Strategy Shape the Long-Run Supply of Public Knowledge? -- Innovation, IP and India: The Dichotomy Between Facts and Fiction -- The Law and Politics of Pharmaceutical Patents in India -- IPRs in ChinaMarket-Oriented Innovation or Policy-Induced Rent-Seeking? -- Estimates of the Value of Patent Rights in China -- Patent-Information Based Study on Patenting Behavior in China.","note":{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"edited by Kung-Chung Liu, Uday S.

As such, their use in legal texts is virtually inevitable. If a law contains vague terms, the question whether it applies to a particular case often lacks a clear answer. One of the fundamental pillars of the rule of law is legal certainty. The determinacy of the law enables people to use it as a guide and places judges in the position to decide impartially. Vagueness poses a threat to these ideals. In borderline cases, the law seems to be indeterminate and thus incapable of serving its core rule of law value. In the philosophy of language, vagueness has become one of the hottest topics of the last two decades. Linguists and philosophers have investigated what distinguishes 'soritical' vagueness from other kinds of linguistic indeterminacy, such as ambiguity, generality, open texture, and family resemblance concepts. There is a vast literature that discusses the logical, semantic, pragmatic, and epistemic aspects of these phenomena. Bringing together leading scholars working on the topic of vagueness in philosophy and in law, this book fosters a dialogue between philosophers and legal scholars by examining how philosophers conceive vagueness in law from their theoretical perspective and how legal theorists make use of philosophical theories of vagueness.\""},"tableOfContents":"Vagueness and law: philosophical and legal perspectives / Geert Keil and Ralf Poscher -- Philosophical and jurisprudential issues of vagueness / Stephen Schiffer -- Vagueness in law: placing the blame where it's due / Diana Raffman -- An intentionalist account of vagueness: a legal perspective / Ralf Poscher -- Can legal practice adjudicate between theories of vagueness? / Hrafn Asgeirsson -- Semantics, metaphysics, and objectivity in the law / Michael S.

This defiance has affected the Union profoundly, and in a multi-faceted assessment of this phenomenon, The Enforcement of EU Law and Values: Ensuring Member States' Compliance, dissects the essence of this crisis, examining its history and offering coping methods for the years to come. Defiance is not a new concept and this volume explores the richness of EU-level and national-level examples of historical defiance - the French Empty Chair policy-, the Luxembourg compromise, and the FP crisis in Austria - and draws on the experience of the US legal system and that of the integration projects on other continents. Building on this legal-political context, the book focuses on the assessment of the adequacy of the enforcement mechanisms whilst learning from EU integration history. Structured in four parts, the volume studies (1) theoretical issues on defiance in the context of multi-layered legal orders, (2) EU mechanisms of acquis and values' enforcement, (3) comparative perspective on law-enforcement in multi-layered legal systems, and (4) case-studies of defiance in the EU.--"},"tableOfContents":["Introductory remarks / Andrs Jakab and Dimitry Kochenov -- The acquis and its principles : The enforcement of the 'law' vs. the enforcement of 'values' in the EU / Dimitry Kochenov -- On the legal enforcement of values, the importance of the institutional context / Giulio Itzcovich -- Pluralism and systemic defiance in the EU / Matej Avbelj -- Infringement proceedings / Laurence Gormley -- Making effective use of Article 260 TFEU / Pl Wenners -- Preliminary references as a means for enforcing EU law / Morten Broberg -- Francovich enforcement analysed and illustrated by German (and English) law / Norbert Reich -- The bite, the bark, and the howl : Article 7 TEU and the rule of law initiatives / Leonard Besselink -- Compliance and enforcement in economic policy coordination in EMU / Fabian Amtenbrink and Ren Repasi -- Rule of law values in decentralized public enforcement of EU competition law / KJ Cseres -- Soft law and the enforcement of EU law / Oana Stefan --^","Protecting EU values reverse Solange and the rule of law framework / Armin von Bogdandy, Carlino Antphler, Michael Ioannidis -- A democracy commission of one's own, or : what it would take for the EU to safeguard liberal democracy in its member States / Jan-Werner Mller -- Application of the EU CFR by national courts in purely domestic cases / Andrs Jakab -- Enforcement of federal law against the German lnder / Dirk Hanschel -- Enforcement of federal law in Belgium Federal State / Cline Romainville and Marc Verdussen -- Regional defiance and enforcement of federal law in Spain : the claims for sovereignty in the Basque country and Catalonia / Alberto Lpez-Basaguren -- Enforcement of national law against subnational units in the United States / Mark Tushnet -- Enforcement of ECtHR judgments / lisabeth Lambert Abdelgawad -- Enforcing WTO law / Antonello Tancredi --^","Enforcement of UN Security Council resolutions and of International Court of Justice judgments : the unreliability of political enforcement mechanisms / Irne Couzigou -- Securing compliance with democracy requirements in regional organizations / Carlos Closa -- Defiance by a Constitutional Court : Germany / Franz C.

The idea for it sprang from the often heated debates among intellectual property scholars on the possibilities and the limits of copyright. Copyright law has been broadening its scope for decades now, and as a result it often clashes with other rights (frequently, fundamental rights), raising the question of which right prevails. The papers represent the product of intensive research by experts, who employ rigorous interpretative methodologies while keeping an eye on comparison and on the impacts of new technologies on law. The contributions concentrate on the \"propertization\" of copyright; on the principle of exhaustion of the distribution right; on the conflict between users' privacy and personal data needs; and on the balance between copyright and academic freedom. Starting from the difficulties inherently connected to the difficult task of balancing rights that respond to opposing interests, each essay analyzes techniques and arguments applied by institutional decision-makers in trying to solve this dilemma. Each author applies a specific methodology involving legal comparison, while taking into account the European framework for copyright and related rights. This work represents a unique piece of scholarship, in which a single issue is read through different lenses, demonstrating the need to reconcile copyright with other fundamental areas of law."},"tableOfContents":"EU Copyright Law Between Property and Fundamental Rights.

Before the 1997 retrocession to China, fears were widespread that the rights and freedoms enjoyed under colonial rule would be eroded, that the rule of law would be weakened and that corruption would increase. Soon, the first blows were struck against the rule of law via an NPCSC ruling which overturned the judgment of the Court of Final Appeal. Successive interventions by Beijing in Hong Kong's legal and political affairs have given rise to fears about the loss of the rule of law and loss of identity. These fears have subsequently provoked mass street demonstrations, including the 'Umbrella Revolution' of 2014. But, as this book shows, Hong Kongers also use less explicit arts of resistance to maintain their identity.--"},"tableOfContents":"Introduction: the lie of the land -- Walls of law -- Transitional fears and fantasies -- Danger, death and disappearance -- The disappearance of Yu Man-Hon -- Patrolling the walls of law -- The law wars: wayward children and the right of abode -- The law wars: the flag cases -- The law wars : article 23 -- The law wars: law as politics, politics as law -- The law wars: law and civil society -- The law wars: interpreting the law -- The culture wars: globalism, nationalism and localism -- The culture wars: creating the nation -- The culture wars: education and the cultivation of identity -- The culture wars: history, identity and nostalgia -- The culture wars: freedom of the press -- Conclusion: lost and found.","note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"Carol A.
