Private international law (conflict of laws) and civil procedure rules concerning the application and ascertainment of foreign law differ significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Combining general and individual national reports, this volume demonstrates when and how foreign law is applied, ascertained, interpreted and reviewed by appeal courts. Traditionally, conflicts lawyers have been faced with two contrasting approaches. Civil law jurisdictions characterize foreign law as "law" and provide for the ex officio application and ascertainment of foreign law by judges. Common law jurisdictions consider foreign law as "fact" and require that parties plead and prove foreign law. A closer look at various reports, however, reveals more differentiated features with their own nuances among civil law jurisdictions, and the difference of the treatment of foreign law from other facts in common law jurisdictions. This challenges the appropriacy of the conventional "law-fact" dichotomy. This book further examines the need for facilitating access to foreign law. After carefully analyzing the benefits and drawbacks of existing instruments, this book explores alternative methods for enhancing access to foreign law and considers practical ways of obtaining information on foreign law. It remains to be seen whether and the extent to which legal systems around the world will integrate and converge in their treatment of foreign law"--Back cover.","[*] 9783319565743 [*] 3319565729 [*] 978289973 1-78643-512-8 [*] 9783319565729","[*] eng [*] English","xiii, 643 pages ; 25 cm."

This book will be of particular interest to students and scholars of EU Law and Criminal Law"-- This book represents a first attempt to investigate the relations between Law and Agroecology. There is a need to adopt a transdisciplinary approach to multifunctional agriculture in order to integrate the agroecological paradigm in legal regulation. This does not require a super-law that hierarchically purports to incorporate and supplant the existing legal fields; rather, it calls for the creation of a trans-law that progressively works to coordinate interlegalities between different legal fields, respecting their autonomy but emphasizing their common historical roots in rus in the process. Rus, the rural phenomenon as a whole, reflects the plurality and interdependence of different complex systems based jointly on the land as a central point of reference. “Rural” is more than “agricultural”: if agriculture is understood traditionally as an activity aimed at exploiting the land for the production of material goods for use, consumption and private exchange, rurality marks the reintegration of agriculture into a broader sphere, one that is not only economic, but also social and cultural; not only material, but also ideal, relational, historical, and symbolic; and not only private, but also public. In approaching rus, the natural and social sciences first became specialized, multiplied, and compartmentalized in a plurality of first-order disciplines; later, they began a process of integration into Agroecology as a second-order, multi-perspective and shared research platform. Today, Agroecology is a transdiscipline that integrates other fields of knowledge into the concept of agroecosystems viewed as socio-ecological systems. However, the law seems to still be stuck in the first stage. Following a reductionist approach, law has deconstructed and shattered the universe of rus into countless, disjointed legal elementary particles, multiplying the planes of analysis and, in particular, keeping Agricultural Law and Environmental Law two separate fields.  .","[*] 9783662466179 [*] 9783662466162 1-78643-512-8 [*] 10.1007/978-3-662-46617-9","[*] eng [*] English","XIX, 494 p. 50 illus., 14 illus. in color. online resource."

"-- "This book, edited by Prof. Randall S. Abate of Florida A&M University College of Law, seeks to fill the gap between the complex legal issues that matter most to the environmental law and animal law movements. Environmental law, with its intricate layers of international, federal, state, and local laws, has a longer history and is more established than its animal law counterpart. Yet, animal law faces many of the same legal and strategic challenges that environmental law faced in seeking to establish a more secure foothold in the United States and abroad. As such, animal law stands to gain valuable insights from the lessons of the environmental law movement's experience in confronting those challenges. The 17 chapters contained in this book compare the very different trajectories of the two movements' regulatory histories and examine the legal intersections that may exist across them. Professor Abate draws on the talents of 22 experts from academia, the nonprofit community, and the legal profession to examine the ways in which animal rights and welfare law can benefit from lessons learned in the environmental field. Providing various contexts and perspectives from U.S. law, foreign domestic law, and international law, the book addresses a myriad of substantive issues, including climate change, international trade, agriculture, invasive species, lead pollution, and fisheries management, as well as procedural issues, such as standing and damages. The book concludes with a vision for the future on how animal law can learn from environmental law and how the two movements can better coordinate their common objectives"--Back cover.

It analyzes the application of basic rights and human rights, which are traditionally understood as public law rights, in private law, and discusses the related spillover effects and changing perspectives in legal doctrine and practice. It provides examples where basic rights and human rights influence judicial reasoning and lead to changes of legislation in contract law, tort law, property law, family law, and copyright law. Providing both context and background analysis for any critical examination of the horizontal effect of fundamental rights in private law, the book contributes to the current debate on an important issue that deserves the attention of legal practitioners, scholars, judges and others involved in the developments in a variety of the world's jurisdictions.

One of the most comprehensive and long-standing of these is the Common Core of European Private Law Project, launched in 1993. Within this Project, over 200 professionals have collaborated to create a painstaking comparative analysis of European legal systems. This book is a collection of these views, as presented in papers delivered at sessions of the General Meetings of the Project between 2001 and 2005. Since 2004, the Project and its publications have attempted to use the specific techniques of the factual approach as the main tool for understanding private law and the legal foundations of the new EU members. This perspective created what has been termed the 'Ten New Treasury Boxes - The European Enlargement and the Common Core Project' in which leading scholars from new EU countries addressed both the impact of the integration of EU law into their own legal systems and the challenges that the 'Common Core' method of legal analysis faces.

"-- This book examines the role played by domestic and international judges in the “flexibilization” of legal systems through general principles. It features revised papers that were presented at the Annual Conference of the European-American Consortium for Legal Education, held at the University of Parma, Italy, May 2014. This volume is organized in four sections, where the topic is mainly explored from a comparative perspective, and includes case studies. The first section covers theoretical issues. It offers an analysis of principles in shaping Dworkin’s theories about international law, a reflection on the role of procedural principles in defining the role of the judiciary, a view on the role of general principles in transnational judicial communication, a study on the recognition of international law from formal criteria to substantive principles, and an inquiry from the viewpoint of neo-constitutionalism.^ The second section contains studies on the role of general principles in selected legal systems, including International Law, European Union Law as well as Common Law systems. The third section features an analysis of select legal principles in a comparative perspective, with a particular focus on the comparison between European and American experiences. The fourth and last section explores selected principles in given areas of law, including the misuse of the lex specialis principle in the relationship between international human rights law and international humanitarian law, the role of the judiciary in Poland as regards discrimination for sexual orientation, and the impact of the ECtHR case law on Italian criminal law with regard to the principle of legality.^ Overall, the book offers readers a thoughtful reflection on how the interpretation, application, and development of general principles of law by the judiciary contribute to the evolution of legal systems at both the domestic and international levels as well as further their reciprocal interactions.

The book collects the commentary of a distinguished set of international law scholars, including five well-known international judges. The contributors consider not only the history of the Corfu Channel Judgment and its contribution to the development of international law, but also its resonance in many contemporary problems of international law"-- The Netherlands Yearbook of International Law was first published in 1970. It offers a forum for the publication of scholarly articles of a more general nature in the area of public international law including the law of the european Union.   One of the key functions or purposes of international law (and law in general for that matter) is to provide long-term stability and legal certainty. Yet, international legal rules may also function as tools to deal with non-permanent or constantly changing issues, and rather than stable, international law may have to be flexible or adaptive. Prima facie, one could think of two main types of temporary aspects relevant from the perspective of international law. First, the nature of the object addressed by international law or the ‘problem’ that international law aims to address may be inherently temporary (temporary objects). Second, a subject of international law may be created for a specific period of time, after the elapse of which this entity ceases to exist (temporary subjects). These types of temporariness raise several questions from the perspective of international law, which are hardly addressed from a more conceptual perspective.

The contributors consider not only the history of the Corfu Channel Judgment and its contribution to the development of international law, but also its resonance in many contemporary problems of international law"-- The Netherlands Yearbook of International Law was first published in 1970. It offers a forum for the publication of scholarly articles of a more general nature in the area of public international law including the law of the european Union.   One of the key functions or purposes of international law (and law in general for that matter) is to provide long-term stability and legal certainty. Yet, international legal rules may also function as tools to deal with non-permanent or constantly changing issues, and rather than stable, international law may have to be flexible or adaptive. Prima facie, one could think of two main types of temporary aspects relevant from the perspective of international law. First, the nature of the object addressed by international law or the ‘problem’ that international law aims to address may be inherently temporary (temporary objects). Second, a subject of international law may be created for a specific period of time, after the elapse of which this entity ceases to exist (temporary subjects). These types of temporariness raise several questions from the perspective of international law, which are hardly addressed from a more conceptual perspective. This volume of the Netherlands Yearbook of International Law aims to do exactly that by asking the question of how international law reacts to various types of temporary issues. Put differently, where does international law stand on the continuum of predictability and pragmatism when it comes to temporary issues or institutions?

Enright's book describes clear and simple techniques for working with law. It explains why the technique is needed and what it achieves, and then provides a model for doing it. Each model consists of a step by step guide for performing the relevant task. Legal Technique is structured to be the textbook in an introductory law course where the techniques are described, and intended for re-use in later courses on substantive law where these techniques must be further taught and practised in the context of those subjects."--Publisher.

This book will be of particular interest to students and scholars of EU Law and Criminal Law"-- EU law is an autonomous legal system. It requires its own methodology, independent of the national traditions of the Member States. The contributions to this volume provide elements of a genuinely European legal method. They discuss the foundations of European legal methodology in Roman law and in the development of national legal methods in the 19th century as well as the economic and comparative background. Core issues of legal methods such as the sources of law, the interpretation of EU primary law and secondary legislation, the concretisation of general clauses, and judicial development of the law are also analysed. Furthermore, the temporal effects of EU directives on the one hand and of judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union raise specific issues of EU law. Contributions are also devoted to issues of a multi-level legal system. Beyond general aspects, directives, in particular, raise special questions: what is their impact on the interpretation of national law; and what are the methodological consequences of a transposition of directives beyond their original scope ('gold-plating')? Further contributions inquire into methodological issues in contract law, employment law, company law, capital market law and competition law. They illustrate the general aspects of European legal methods with a view to specific applications and also reveal specific issues of methods which occur in these areas. Finally, legal methods from national perspectives of different Member States, namely France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom, are examined. The authors reveal national traditions of legal methods and national preconceptions and illustrate the application of EU legal methods in different national contexts.","[*] 9781780682594 [*] 803365527 [*] 921183171 [*] 178068259X 1-78643-512-8","[*] eng [*] English [*] ger","xxix, 749 pages ; 25 cm."

In particular, it assesses whether the consumer benchmarks are suitable in terms of achieving the three goals of the Directive: achieving a high level of consumer protection, increasing the smooth functioning of the internal market, and improving competition in the market as such. In addition to providing a thorough analysis of the consumer benchmarks and their relationship to the goals of the Directive, at a more practical level, the book provides insight into the working and consequences of the benchmarks that can be used in the evaluation of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive and its application by the CJEU. This assessment is important because the Directive, while promising to regulate unfair commercial practices in a way that achieves the Directive’s goals, has removed the possibility for Member States to regulate unfair commercial practices themselves.","[*] 10.1007/978-3-319-13924-1 1-78643-512-8 [*] 9783319139234 [*] 9783319139241","[*] eng [*] English [*] ger","XXI, 244 p. online resource."

Particularly in civil law jurisdictions – as opposed to those of the common law – the notion is not well known. What does it stand for? It is best illustrated by examples. One of the best known being the British case of Blake v Attorney General, [2001] 1 AC 268. In which a double spy had been imprisoned by the UK government before escaping and settling in the former Soviet Union. While there wrote a book on his experiences, upon which the UK government claimed the proceeds of the book. The House of Lords, as it then was, allowed the claim on the basis of Blake’s breach of his employment contract. Other examples are the infringement of intellectual property rights, where the damages of the owner are limited, but the profits of the wrongdoer immense. In such cases, the question arises whether the infringing party should be disgorged of his profits. This volume aims at establishing the notion of disgorgement of profits as a keyword in the discourse of private law. It does not purport to answer the question whether or not such damages should or should not be awarded. It does however aim to contribute to the discussion, the arguments in favour and against, and the organisation of the various actions.  .

It shows that, to understand the legal framework underlying the daily operations of family businesses, one needs legal analysis, empirical data, psychological and sociological knowledge. The book works on the premise that, since many businesses have been founded by families, practitioners need to develop an understanding of the legal background of such businesses and build up experience to be able to create contracts, trusts, foundations and other legal mechanisms to give shape to systems and procedures for the transfer of shares and control within the family. Comparing the national legal order, techniques, and mechanisms in a range of countries, the book examines parallel developments in these fields of law across the world. Finally, it demonstrates the room for companies, shareholders and the members of a family to develop individual solutions within the legal framework for transferring businesses and shares to the next generation.

The contributors consider not only the history of the Corfu Channel Judgment and its contribution to the development of international law, but also its resonance in many contemporary problems of international law"-- [*] "This book takes stock of the development of criminal law in the context of the European Community and the European Union, and considers whether it has led to a European criminal policy, whilst also examining the legal effects European-level initiatives in the field have had on national criminal law and on criminal suspects. The work reflects on the interaction between the law of the European Community and national criminal law since the signing of the Treaty of Rome and against this backdrop reviews the supremacy of European Community law over conflicting national criminal law, the past legislative practice of harmonised 'administrative' penalties and their impact on national legal systems as well as the development of relevant European Community principles of fundamental rights. The work goes on to explore whether there are fields in which the European Community might enact directly applicable criminal penalties in the form of EC regulations and also examines related doctrinal concerns considered by the Court of Justice in its earlier case law on the interface between EC law and national criminal law.

"-- This book is one of the first to link company law to the law of succession by concentrating on family businesses. It shows that, to understand the legal framework underlying the daily operations of family businesses, one needs legal analysis, empirical data, psychological and sociological knowledge. The book works on the premise that, since many businesses have been founded by families, practitioners need to develop an understanding of the legal background of such businesses and build up experience to be able to create contracts, trusts, foundations and other legal mechanisms to give shape to systems and procedures for the transfer of shares and control within the family. Comparing the national legal order, techniques, and mechanisms in a range of countries, the book examines parallel developments in these fields of law across the world. Finally, it demonstrates the room for companies, shareholders and the members of a family to develop individual solutions within the legal framework for transferring businesses and shares to the next generation.

Part 1 sets up the conceptual framework for consideration of the reforms, and pursues a contrast between transformational and traditional developments; where the former aim at change designed to ensure social justice in land laws, and the latter aim to continue the overall thrust of colonial approaches to land laws and land administration. Part 2 provides an in-depth and critical survey of the land law reforms introduced into each country during the era of land law reform which commenced around 1990. The overall effect of the reforms has, Patrick McAuslan argues, been traditional: it was colonial policy to move towards land markets, individualisation of land tenure and the demise of customary tenure, all of which characterise the post 1990 reforms.

In particular, it assesses whether the consumer benchmarks are suitable in terms of achieving the three goals of the Directive: achieving a high level of consumer protection, increasing the smooth functioning of the internal market, and improving competition in the market as such. In addition to providing a thorough analysis of the consumer benchmarks and their relationship to the goals of the Directive, at a more practical level, the book provides insight into the working and consequences of the benchmarks that can be used in the evaluation of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive and its application by the CJEU. This assessment is important because the Directive, while promising to regulate unfair commercial practices in a way that achieves the Directive’s goals, has removed the possibility for Member States to regulate unfair commercial practices themselves.

"-- Disgorgement of profits is not exactly a household word in private law. Particularly in civil law jurisdictions – as opposed to those of the common law – the notion is not well known. What does it stand for? It is best illustrated by examples. One of the best known being the British case of Blake v Attorney General, [2001] 1 AC 268. In which a double spy had been imprisoned by the UK government before escaping and settling in the former Soviet Union. While there wrote a book on his experiences, upon which the UK government claimed the proceeds of the book. The House of Lords, as it then was, allowed the claim on the basis of Blake’s breach of his employment contract. Other examples are the infringement of intellectual property rights, where the damages of the owner are limited, but the profits of the wrongdoer immense. In such cases, the question arises whether the infringing party should be disgorged of his profits. This volume aims at establishing the notion of disgorgement of profits as a keyword in the discourse of private law. It does not purport to answer the question whether or not such damages should or should not be awarded. It does however aim to contribute to the discussion, the arguments in favour and against, and the organisation of the various actions.  .

Why is contemporary terrorism such a specific emergency justifying new laws? Using legal and philosophical reflections, this study looks at how we are changing society.

[*] "Land Law Reform in East Africa reviews development and changes in the statutory land laws of 7 countries in Eastern Africa over the period 1961-2011. The book is divided into two parts. Part 1 sets up the conceptual framework for consideration of the reforms, and pursues a contrast between transformational and traditional developments; where the former aim at change designed to ensure social justice in land laws, and the latter aim to continue the overall thrust of colonial approaches to land laws and land administration. Part 2 provides an in-depth and critical survey of the land law reforms introduced into each country during the era of land law reform which commenced around 1990. The overall effect of the reforms has, Patrick McAuslan argues, been traditional: it was colonial policy to move towards land markets, individualisation of land tenure and the demise of customary tenure, all of which characterise the post 1990 reforms. The culmination of over 50 years of working in this area, Land Law Reform in East Africa will be invaluable reading for scholars of land law, and of law and development more generally."-- [*] "This book takes stock of the development of criminal law in the context of the European Community and the European Union, and considers whether it has led to a European criminal policy, whilst also examining the legal effects European-level initiatives in the field have had on national criminal law and on criminal suspects. The work reflects on the interaction between the law of the European Community and national criminal law since the signing of the Treaty of Rome and against this backdrop reviews the supremacy of European Community law over conflicting national criminal law, the past legislative practice of harmonised 'administrative' penalties and their impact on national legal systems as well as the development of relevant European Community principles of fundamental rights.

While the number of legal instruments at international, European and national level continue to increase, the actual enforcement of the relevant law remains insufficient, seriously impairing the effectiveness of environmental law. Based on the assumption that nothing undermines the credibility of public authorities more than law that is not applied, this research review analyses the most important articles on the enforcement of international, EU and national environmental law that approach the issue from multiple angles and endeavour to provide solutions for improvement. The review will be a valuable tool for scholars and practitioners as it provides acute insight into existing concerns and intends to stimulate discussion on possible ways to reform and bolster environmental law enforcement.

An increasingly complex set of legal actors now seek to influence this development, including securities regulators, bankers, accountants, lawyers, local-level mediators and some of China's newly rich. Whilst the rising middle class wants to voice its interests and concerns, the CPC strives to maintain its leading role. This book provides a critical appraisal of China's deepening socialist rule of law and looks ahead to the implications of the domestic reforms for the international legal domain. With contributions from leading Chinese law specialists, it draws on specific illustrations from judicial reform, constitutional law, procedural law, anti-corruption, property law and urban development, socio-economic dispute resolution and Chinese macroeconomics. The book questions how China's domestic law reforms will impact international legal systems, and how international law can be used in managing key regional and bilateral relationships and in dispute resolution, such as in the South China Sea and international trade. Assessing the state and direction of domestic law reform and including debates around the legal implications of some of China's most pressing foreign policy challenges today, this volume will be of huge interest to students, scholars and practitioners with an interest in Asian law, Chinese law, international law, comparative law and law reform"--Page i.

Within the framework of different important areas of EU law, such as the internal market, consumer protection law, social law, investment law, environment law, migration law, legal translation and terminology, it examines the Union’s approach to the regulation and management of legal risks. Over the years, the Union has come to a point where it is becoming increasingly difficult to justify its authority to regulate in various areas of law. In managing legal risks deriving from the diversity of Member States’ laws, which create barriers to trade and hinder the Union’s economy, the Union itself has actually produced new legal risks that now have to be addressed. This failure on the part of EU institutions to manage legal risks has contributed to legal uncertainty for actors operating on the internal market. This book intends to contribute to the Union’s smoother functioning and continuing development by proposing effective concrete solutions for managing the legal risks distorting the development of various areas of EU law. It pursues an innovative and effective approach to identify legal risks, their causes at the EU level and their impacts on the functioning of the Union and its Member States. By presenting new approaches in this context, the first book on legal risk management in the EU will actively promote the improvement of the EU lawmaking process and the application of EU law in practice.","1-78471-835-1 [*] ^^2015034031 [*] 9783319285962 (online) [*] 948968610 [*] 9783319285955 (hd.bd.)

Within the framework of different important areas of EU law, such as the internal market, consumer protection law, social law, investment law, environment law, migration law, legal translation and terminology, it examines the Union’s approach to the regulation and management of legal risks. Over the years, the Union has come to a point where it is becoming increasingly difficult to justify its authority to regulate in various areas of law. In managing legal risks deriving from the diversity of Member States’ laws, which create barriers to trade and hinder the Union’s economy, the Union itself has actually produced new legal risks that now have to be addressed. This failure on the part of EU institutions to manage legal risks has contributed to legal uncertainty for actors operating on the internal market. This book intends to contribute to the Union’s smoother functioning and continuing development by proposing effective concrete solutions for managing the legal risks distorting the development of various areas of EU law. It pursues an innovative and effective approach to identify legal risks, their causes at the EU level and their impacts on the functioning of the Union and its Member States. By presenting new approaches in this context, the first book on legal risk management in the EU will actively promote the improvement of the EU lawmaking process and the application of EU law in practice.","[*] 318057903 1-78471-835-1 [*] ^^2015034031 [*] 948968610 [*] ^^2009013978 [*] 9781604424461 (pbk. : alk. paper) [*] 919480902","[*] eng [*] English [*] ger","1 v. ; 26 cm."

The entries are organized in three sections: the first dealing with the transitional period of fifteenth-century editions of medieval authorities, the second spanning the early modern period from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, and the third focusing on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The contributors are scholars from all over the world. Each ‘old book’ is analyzed by a recognized specialist in the specific field of interest. Individual entries give a short biography of the author and discuss the significance of the works in the time and setting of their publication, and in their broader influence on the development of law worldwide. Introductory essays explore the development of Western legal traditions, especially the influence of the English common law, and of Roman and canon law on legal writers, and the borrowings and interaction between them. The book goes beyond the study of institutions and traditions of individual countries to chart a broader perspective on the transmission of legal concepts across legal, political, and geographical boundaries. Examining the branches of this genealogical tree of books makes clear their pervasive influence on modern legal systems, including attempts at rationalizing custom or creating new hybrid systems by transplanting Western legal concepts into other jurisdictions.","[*] ^^2015034031 [*] ^^^14002486^ 10.1007/978-3-319-45567-9 [*] 2154204 [*] 919480902 [*] 971511873 [*] ^^2017006682","[*] English [*] ger [*] eng","[*] 72 videocassettes: sd., col. ; 1/2 in.

It brings together for the first time different elements of EU tort law to provide a comprehensive overview of the institutional liability of the EU, member state liability and liability arising from a variety of EU legislation. Contributors are experts in their field and range from the UK and Ireland to France, Germany, the Netherlands and Hungary. The impact of EU tort law on national legal systems is wide-ranging. It extends to areas as diverse as consumer law, competition law, data protection law, employment law, insurance law and financial services law. The Research Handbook provides a detailed analysis of these areas of law and considers the extent to which we can now identify an emerging European culture of tort law. It further analyses the impact of proposals to harmonise European tort law and considers the impact of Brexit on EU tort law. The Research Handbook offers an authoritative reference point for academics, students and practitioners studying or working in EU law, private law and comparative law. Comprehensive and informative, it is also accessible for those approaching the subject for the first time.","[*] ^^2015034031 [*] ^^^14002486^ [*] 2154204 [*] 919480902 [*] 971511873 [*] ^^2017006682 9781785365720 (e-book)","[*] English [*] ger [*] eng","[*] 72 videocassettes: sd., col. ; 1/2 in. 1 online resource (496 pages) [*] 99.25 linear feet.

"-- This anthology highlights the theoretical foundations as well as the various applications of Behavioural Law and Economics in European legal culture. By the same token, it fosters the dialogue between European and American Law and Economics scholars. The traditional neo-classical microeconomic theory explains human behaviour by using Rational Choice. According to this model, people tend to maximize the difference between expected utility and cost (“expected utility theory”). This theory includes three assumptions: (1) unbounded rationality, (2) unbounded self-interest, and (3) unbounded willpower. Behavioural Economics questions these assumptions and endeavours to render economic analysis more realistic by underpinning it with psychological insights. In recent years, the influence of Behavioural Economics on the Economic Analysis of Law has gained momentum. Behavioural Law and Economics generates a better theoretical understanding of legal phenomena and offers a multitude of applications in legislation and legal adjudication. This volume is testament to the growing and thriving Law and Economics movement in Europe. The European Law and Economics community has steadily grown and the yearly Law and Economics Conference at the law faculty of the University of Lucerne has successfully become a guiding star in the vast sky of Law and Economics.

This book traces the rationale for aggression within the Islamic tradition, and assesses the meaning and evolution of the contentious concept of jihad. The book reveals that there has never been a unified position on what Islamic warfare tangibly entails, due to the complexity of relevant sources and discordant historical dynamics that have shaped the contours of jihad. Onder Bakircioglu advocates a dynamic reading of Islamic law and military tradition; one which prioritises the demands of contemporary international relations and considers the meaning and application of jihad as contingent on the socio-political forces of each historical epoch. This book will be of great interest to scholars and students of international law, Islamic law, war and security studies, and the law of armed conflict"-- [*] "The question of how the Sharia (Islamic law) regulates the notions of just recourse to, and just conduct in, war has long been the subject of heated controversy. This book offers a scholarly exploration of the Islamic laws of war in general, and the controversial concept of jihad in particular. The book seeks to understand whether the doctrine of jihad complies with the principles of contemporary international law, which envisages unilateral force only in cases of self-defence. The book undertakes a historical and contextual examination of the sources of Islamic law with a view to illustrating their continuing relevance to the debate on the doctrine of jihad and its dynamic interpretation. The book traces the origins and evolution of the Islamic jus in bello and jus ad bellum rules showing how the fighting verses of the Qur'an and other sources of Sharia have developed over time. Onder Bakircioglu shows how military jihad might be interpreted in line with the modern political and military context of international relations proposing a contextual interpretation of jihad in the United Nations era. The book surveys recent Islamic state practice on aggressive force, be it committed by state or non-state actors in order to examine whether the basic tenets of Islamic laws of war are compatible with modern international law."--","[*] 0203627601 [*] 10.1007/978-3-319-28335-7 [*] 853494301 [*] 9780203627600 [*] 3-319-28335-9 [*] ^^2014021090 76972566","[*] English [*] ger [*] eng","[*] 72 videocassettes: sd., col. ; 1/2 in.

Yet, despite the best efforts of international institutions, scholars and others to assert the universal application of international law, its relevance and applicability has been influenced, if not directed, by political power. At present, the international system appears to be moving towards multipolarity, with various sites of power competing to exert influence in the world today. The ascent of China and India and the "decline of the West" all pose challenges for international law and institutions. With contributors from a variety of countries providing perspectives from the disciplines of international law and international relations theory, International Law in a Multipolar World addresses the implications that multipolarity poses for the international legal system. The book features contributions addressing some of the questions multipolarity poses for the international legal system. The contributions to this volume from a range of contributors including Nigel White, Michael Schmitt, Richard Burchill, Alexander Orakhelashvili and Christian Pippan, explore issues such as the use of force, governance, sovereign equality, regionalism and the relevance of the United Nations in a multipolar world, while considering the overarching theme of the relationship between power and law. International Law in a Multipolar World is of particular interest to academics and students of public international law, international relations theory and international politics"-- [*] "Since the creation of the United Nations in 1945, international law has sought to configure itself as a universal system. And yet, despite the best efforts of international institutions, scholars and others to assert the universal application of international law, its relevance and applicability has been influenced, if not directed, by political power. Over the past decade, discourse has tended to focus on the implications for international law of a unipolar world, characterised by US hegemony. However, that the international system may now be experiencing a tendency towards multipolarity, with various sites of power able to exert a telling influence on international relations and international law. Recent events such as Russia's excursion into Georgia, the breakdown of the Doha round of trade negotiations, the USA's questionable actions in the War on Terror, the prominence of emerging nuclear powers, China's assertions of its own interests on a global scale, and the rise of regional trading blocs, all pose significant questions for international law and the international legal order.

The European Union has played a leading role in this area of law and its initiatives are fully explored. It pays particular attention to the most recent development in collective redress and alternative/online dispute resolution. By adopting multiple research methods, including a comparative study of the EU/US approach; historical analysis of protective conflict of laws; doctrinal analysis of legal provisions and economic analysis of law to provide, it provides the most comprehensive examination of frameworks in cross-border consumer contracts.-- [*] "This book takes stock of the development of criminal law in the context of the European Community and the European Union, and considers whether it has led to a European criminal policy, whilst also examining the legal effects European-level initiatives in the field have had on national criminal law and on criminal suspects. The work reflects on the interaction between the law of the European Community and national criminal law since the signing of the Treaty of Rome and against this backdrop reviews the supremacy of European Community law over conflicting national criminal law, the past legislative practice of harmonised 'administrative' penalties and their impact on national legal systems as well as the development of relevant European Community principles of fundamental rights. The work goes on to explore whether there are fields in which the European Community might enact directly applicable criminal penalties in the form of EC regulations and also examines related doctrinal concerns considered by the Court of Justice in its earlier case law on the interface between EC law and national criminal law. This book will be of particular interest to students and scholars of EU Law and Criminal Law"-- [*] "Law and Gender in Modern Ireland: Critique and Reform is the first generalist text to tackle the intersection of law and gender in this jurisdiction for over two decades. As such, it could hardly have come at a more opportune moment. The topic of law and gender, perhaps more so than at any other time in Irish history, has assumed a dominant place in political and academic debate. Among scholars and policy-makers alike, the regulation of gendered bodies, and the legal status of sexual and gendered identities, is now a highly visible fault line in public discourse. Debates over reproductive justice (exemplified by the recent referendum to remove the '8th Amendment'), increased rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons (including the public-sanctioned introduction of same-sex marriage) and the historic mistreatment of women and young girls have re-shaped Irish public and political life, and encouraged Irish society to re-examine long-unchallenged gender norms. While ma ny traditional flashpoints, such as abortion and prostitution/sex work, remain, there are also new questions, including surrogacy and the gendered experience of asylum frameworks, which have emerged. As policy-makers seek to enact reforms, they face a population with increasingly polarised perceptions of gender and a legal structure ill-equipped for modern realities. This edited volume directly addresses modern Irish debates on law and gender. Providing an overview of the existing rules and standards, as well as exploring possible options for reform, the collection stands as an important statement on the law in this jurisdiction, and as an invaluable resource for pursuing gendered social change. While the edited collection applies a doctrinal methodology to explain current statutes, case law and administrative practices, the contributors also invoke critical gender, queer and race perspectives to identify and problematise existing (and potential) challenges.

The book argues that a better understanding of how soft law shapes and affects different branches of international human rights law not only provides a more dynamic picture of the current state of international human rights, but also helps to unsettle and critically question certain political and doctrinal beliefs. Following introductory chapters that lay out the general conceptual framework, the book is divided in two parts. The first part focuses on cases that examine the role of soft law within human rights regimes where there are established hard law standards, its progressive and regressive effects, and the role that different actors play in the incubation process. The second part focuses on the role of soft law in emerging areas of international law where there is no substantial treaty codification of norms.^ "This volume contributes to the growing field of comparative Jewish and American law, presenting twenty-six essays characterized by a number of distinct features.

[*] Soft law increasingly shapes and impacts the content of international law in multiple ways, from being a first step in a norm-making process to providing detailed rules and technical standards required for the interpretation and the implementation of treaties. This is especially true in the area of human rights. While relatively few human rights treaties have been adopted at the UN level in the last two decades, the number of declarations, resolutions, conclusions, and principles has grown significantly. In some areas, soft law has come to fill a void in the absence of treaty law, exerting a degree of normative force exceeding its non-binding character. In others areas, soft law has become a battleground for interpretative struggles to expand and limit human rights protection in the context of existing regimes. Despite these developments, little attention has been paid to soft law within human rights legal scholarship.^ [*] "This book takes stock of the development of criminal law in the context of the European Community and the European Union, and considers whether it has led to a European criminal policy, whilst also examining the legal effects European-level initiatives in the field have had on national criminal law and on criminal suspects.

This book introduces the fundamental monetary law problems of cross-border economic activity and the solutions thereto in international monetary law, and in EU law. After decades of having been neglected by legal scholars, international and European monetary law has attracted increasing attention in recent years. With the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), a full-fledged monetary union between sovereign States has been established for the first time in history. Its construction is primarily a work of law, with the Treaties on European Union (TEU) and on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) together with a number of protocols forming the constitutional basis. Yet, European monetary Integration has never taken place in isolation from international developments. Moreover, international monetary law, namely the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has always played a role - initially as the external monetary addition to the internal market project, after the breakdown of the Bretton Woods System in the 1970s as one of the major driving forces for monetary Integration within the EU. On a fundamental basis, international and European monetary law address the same principled problems of monetary cooperation: how to proceed with financial transactions cross-border where no global currency exists. The present work describes the different approaches and relations and interplay between the two legal regimes.

[*] "Finding English Law: Key Titles for non-UK Lawyers and Researchers provides a listing of current and informative books on one hundred topics of English law. This volume presents global and comparative perspectives on the perpetual pendular movement of family law between status and contract. It contributes to the topical academic debate on ‘family law exceptionalism’ by exploring the blurred lines between public law, private law and family law, and sheds light on the many shades of grey that exist. The contributions focus on both substantive and procedural family law on parents and children and on life partners, with particular attention for contractual arrangements of family formations and of conflict resolution. The hypothesis underlying all contributions was the trend towards contractualisation of family law. A convergent research outcome resulting from the comparison of national reports was the ambivalent position of family law in legal systems worldwide. That comparison shows that, whereas family law is clearly moving towards contract with regard to old family formations, the contrary is true for new family formations. The movement towards contract is rarely considered to be contractualisation pur sang, with civil effect. The movement towards status, finally, does not necessarily witness ‘family law exceptionalism’ vis-à-vis private law, in view of the increasing State interventionism in private law relations in general. In sum, as the volume shows, the high permeability of the demarcations between the State, the family and the market impedes a categorial approach. This volume is based on the general and selected national reports on the topic “Contractualisation of Family Law” that were presented at the XIXth International Congress of Comparative Law in Vienna in July 2014.

It features revised papers that were presented at the Annual Conference of the European-American Consortium for Legal Education, held at the University of Parma, Italy, May 2014. This volume is organized in four sections, where the topic is mainly explored from a comparative perspective, and includes case studies. The first section covers theoretical issues. It offers an analysis of principles in shaping Dworkin’s theories about international law, a reflection on the role of procedural principles in defining the role of the judiciary, a view on the role of general principles in transnational judicial communication, a study on the recognition of international law from formal criteria to substantive principles, and an inquiry from the viewpoint of neo-constitutionalism. The second section contains studies on the role of general principles in selected legal systems, including International Law, European Union Law as well as Common Law systems. The third section features an analysis of select legal principles in a comparative perspective, with a particular focus on the comparison between European and American experiences. The fourth and last section explores selected principles in given areas of law, including the misuse of the lex specialis principle in the relationship between international human rights law and international humanitarian law, the role of the judiciary in Poland as regards discrimination for sexual orientation, and the impact of the ECtHR case law on Italian criminal law with regard to the principle of legality. Overall, the book offers readers a thoughtful reflection on how the interpretation, application, and development of general principles of law by the judiciary contribute to the evolution of legal systems at both the domestic and international levels as well as further their reciprocal interactions.

The scope of comparison includes liability regimes in general and in detail, the correlation between pecuniary remedies available under international law and under domestic law, and special (alternative) compensation systems. All sources of human rights violations are embraced, including historical injustices and systematical and gross violations. The book is a collection of nineteen contributions written by public international law, international human rights and private law experts, covering fifteen European jurisdictions (including Central and Eastern Europe), the United States, Israel and EU law. The contributions, initially prepared for the 19th International Congress of Comparative law in Vienna (2014), present the latest developments in legislation, scholarship and case-law concerning domestic causes of action in cases of human rights abuses. The book concludes with a comparative report which assesses the developments in tort law and public liability law, the role of the constitutionalisation of the right to damages as well as the court practice related to the process of enforcement of human rights through monetary remedies. This country-by-country comparison allows to consider whether the value of protection of human rights as expressed in international treaties, ius cogens and in national constitutional laws justifies the conclusion that the interests at stake should enjoy protection under the existing civil liability rules, or that a new cause of action, or even a whole new set of rules, should be created in national systems"--Unedited summary from book cover.

By overlaying one set of norms on another we overlook the deeply contextual nature of how legal rules operate in a society, and meaningful comparison and discussion is impossible. In this volume, leading experts in Islamic law and international human rights law attempt to deepen the understanding of human rights and Islam, paving the way for a more meaningful debate. Focusing on central areas of controversy, such as freedom of speech and religion, gender equality, and minority rights, the authors examine the contextual nature of how Islamic law and international human rights law are legitimately formed, interpreted, and applied within a community. They examine how these fundamental interests are recognized and protected within the law, and what restrictions are placed on the freedoms associated with them. -- Jacket.

It has been compiled to celebrate the occasion of the 50th birthday of Professor Jan Klabbers, a leading international law and international relations scholar, who has made a significant contribution to the understanding of the sources of international obligations and the idea of constitutionalism in international law. Inspired by Professor Klabbers wide-ranging interests in international law, his determined disregard for disciplinary boundaries and his often provocative views, the book looks at law-making in a colourful variety of different ways and occasionally seeks to push the envelope in terms of what it means to think and write about law and its making. [*] The book includes contributions from respected legal scholars including Eyal Benevisiti, James Crawford, Malgozia Fitzmaurice, Martti Koskenniemi, Bruno Simma and Geir Ulfstein.The first part of the book attempts to situate, on the most abstract and theoretical level, the notion of law-making into a philosophical, historical, social, linguistic and literary context. The second section looks at some of the processes of law-making, the institutions involved and the sometimes unclear divide between law and non-law. Topics covered include: global administrative law; law-making in the EU; regionalism and international law, domestic legal systems and international law; and informal law-making and the changing nature of law in global governance. The third and final part of the book the problems of law-making in particular areas, such as human rights, the law of the sea, environmental law, the law of state responsibility, international humanitarian law, and international criminal law.

The book focuses on exploring the emerging tensions that exist between the demand for legal certainty and the challenges of regulating complex, late modern societies. The book is divided into two parts: the first part focusing on debates around legal certainty at the national level, with a primary emphasis on criminal law; and the second part focusing on debates at the transnational level, with a primary emphasis on the regulation of transnational commercial transactions. In the context of legal modernity, the principle of legal certainty—the idea that the law must be sufficiently clear to provide those subject to legal norms with the means to regulate their own conduct and to protect against the arbitrary use of public power—has operated as a foundational rule of law value. Even though it has not always been fully realized, legal certainty has functioned as a core value and aspiration that has structured normative debates throughout political modernity, both at a national and international level. In recent decades, however, legal certainty has come under increasing pressure from a number of competing demands that are made of contemporary law, in particular the demand that the law be more flexible and responsive to a social environment characterized by rapid social and technological change. The expectation that the law operates in new transnational contexts and regulates every widening sphere of social life has created a new degree of uncertainty, and this change raises difficult questions regarding both the possibility and desirability of legal certainty. This book compiles, in one edited volume, research from a range of substantive areas of civil and criminal law that shares a common interest in understanding the multi-layered challenges of defining legal certainty in a late modern society. The book will be of interest both to lawyers interested in understanding the transformation of core rule of law values in the context of contemporary social change and to political scientists and social theorists.

Besides a detailed overview of the sources of Roman law, the book also includes sections on private and criminal law and procedure, with special attention given to those aspects of Roman law that have particular importance to today's lawyer. The last three chapters of the book offer an overview of the history of Roman law from the early Middle Ages to modern times and illustrate the way in which Roman law furnished the basis of contemporary civil law systems. In this part, special attention is given to the factors that warranted the revival and subsequent reception of Roman law as the ‘common law’ of Continental Europe. Combining the perspectives of legal history with those of social and political history, the book can be profitably read by students and scholars, as well as by general readers with an interest in ancient and early European legal history. The civil law tradition is the oldest legal tradition in the world today, embracing many legal systems currently in force in Continental Europe, Latin America and other parts of the world. Despite the considerable differences in the substantive laws of civil law countries, a fundamental unity exists between them. The most obvious element of unity is the fact that the civil law systems are all derived from the same sources and their legal institutions are classified in accordance with a commonly accepted scheme existing prior to their own development, which they adopted and adapted at some stage in their history. Roman law is both in point of time and range of influence the first catalyst in the evolution of the civil law tradition.

Besides a detailed overview of the sources of Roman law, the book also includes sections on private and criminal law and procedure, with special attention given to those aspects of Roman law that have particular importance to today's lawyer. The last three chapters of the book offer an overview of the history of Roman law from the early Middle Ages to modern times and illustrate the way in which Roman law furnished the basis of contemporary civil law systems. In this part, special attention is given to the factors that warranted the revival and subsequent reception of Roman law as the ‘common law’ of Continental Europe. Combining the perspectives of legal history with those of social and political history, the book can be profitably read by students and scholars, as well as by general readers with an interest in ancient and early European legal history. The civil law tradition is the oldest legal tradition in the world today, embracing many legal systems currently in force in Continental Europe, Latin America and other parts of the world. Despite the considerable differences in the substantive laws of civil law countries, a fundamental unity exists between them. The most obvious element of unity is the fact that the civil law systems are all derived from the same sources and their legal institutions are classified in accordance with a commonly accepted scheme existing prior to their own development, which they adopted and adapted at some stage in their history. Roman law is both in point of time and range of influence the first catalyst in the evolution of the civil law tradition.

Within the framework of different important areas of EU law, such as the internal market, consumer protection law, social law, investment law, environment law, migration law, legal translation and terminology, it examines the Union’s approach to the regulation and management of legal risks. Over the years, the Union has come to a point where it is becoming increasingly difficult to justify its authority to regulate in various areas of law. In managing legal risks deriving from the diversity of Member States’ laws, which create barriers to trade and hinder the Union’s economy, the Union itself has actually produced new legal risks that now have to be addressed. This failure on the part of EU institutions to manage legal risks has contributed to legal uncertainty for actors operating on the internal market. This book intends to contribute to the Union’s smoother functioning and continuing development by proposing effective concrete solutions for managing the legal risks distorting the development of various areas of EU law. It pursues an innovative and effective approach to identify legal risks, their causes at the EU level and their impacts on the functioning of the Union and its Member States. By presenting new approaches in this context, the first book on legal risk management in the EU will actively promote the improvement of the EU lawmaking process and the application of EU law in practice.

Roman private law has been the most admired and imitated system of private law in the world, but it evolved, Watson argues, as a hobby of gentlemen, albeit a hobby that carried social status. The jurists, the private individuals most responsible for legal development, were first and foremost politicians and (in the Empire) bureaucrats; their engagement with the law was primarily to win the esteem of their peers.^ "This unique publication offers a complete history of Roman law, from its early beginnings through to its resurgence in Europe where it was widely applied until the eighteenth century.

[*] The exclusively patrician College of Pontiffs was given a monopoly of interpretation of private law in the mid fifth century B.C. Though the College would lose its exclusivity and monopoly, interpretation of law remained one mark of a Roman gentleman. But only interpretation of the law, not conceptualization or systematization or reform, gave prestige, says Watson. Further, the jurists limited themselves to particular modes of reasoning: no arguments to a ruling could be based on morality, justice, economic welfare, or what was approved elsewhere. No praetor (one of the elected officials who controlled the courts) is famous for introducing reforms, Watson points out, and, in contrast with a nonjurist like Cicero, no jurist theorized about the nature of law. A strong characteristic of Roman law is its relative autonomy, and isolation from the rest of life.^ [*] Researchers from outside the United Kingdom will find the topic descriptions and listings most useful and those based in the UK will find utility in a current, wide-ranging list of legal titles."--Pub. desc.","[*] ^^^94005969^ [*] 0820316695 (alk. paper) [*] 900709424 [*] 830165793 [*] 29878046 [*] 2010323519 1-78536-602-5 [*] 764546571","[*] English [*] eng [*] fre [*] spa [*] ita","[*] 72 videocassettes: sd., col. ; 1/2 in.

The jurists, the private individuals most responsible for legal development, were first and foremost politicians and (in the Empire) bureaucrats; their engagement with the law was primarily to win the esteem of their peers.^ [*] The exclusively patrician College of Pontiffs was given a monopoly of interpretation of private law in the mid fifth century B.C. Though the College would lose its exclusivity and monopoly, interpretation of law remained one mark of a Roman gentleman. But only interpretation of the law, not conceptualization or systematization or reform, gave prestige, says Watson. Further, the jurists limited themselves to particular modes of reasoning: no arguments to a ruling could be based on morality, justice, economic welfare, or what was approved elsewhere. No praetor (one of the elected officials who controlled the courts) is famous for introducing reforms, Watson points out, and, in contrast with a nonjurist like Cicero, no jurist theorized about the nature of law. A strong characteristic of Roman law is its relative autonomy, and isolation from the rest of life.^ This volume addresses an important historiographical gap by assessing the respective contributions of tradition and foreign influences to the 19th century codification of criminal law. More specifically, it focuses on the extent of French influence – among others – in European and American civil law jurisdictions. In this regard, the book seeks to dispel a number of myths concerning the French model’s actual influence on European and Latin American criminal codes. The impact of the Napoleonic criminal code on other jurisdictions was real, but the scope and extent of its influence were significantly less than has sometimes been claimed. The overemphasis on French influence on other civil law jurisdictions is partly due to a fundamental assumption that modern criminal codes constituted a break with the past. The question as to whether they truly broke with the past or were merely a degree of reform touches on a difficult issue, namely, the dichotomy between tradition and foreign influences in the codification of criminal law. Scholarship has unfairly ignored this important subject, an oversight that this book remedies.

They also discuss the challenge of effectively translating the results of scientific evaluations into public health laws and highlight the impact of this growing field."How exactly the law can best be used as a tool for protecting and enhancing the public's health has long been the subject of solely opinion and anecdote.

The twenty-first century has witnessed a fundamental reform of food law in the European Union, to the point where modern EU food law has now come of age. This 'EU Food Law Handbook' presents the most significant elements of these legal developments with contributions from a highly qualified team of academics and practitioners. Their analysis is based on a shared vision of the structure and content of EU food law. The book takes the perspective of food law embedded within general EU law. It highlights the consequences of this combination and provides insights into both substantive and procedural food law. Taking the General Food Law as a focal point, this handbook analyses and explains the institutional, substantive and procedural elements of EU food law. Principles are discussed as well as specific rules addressing food as a product, the processes related to food and communication about food to consumers through labelling. These rules define requirements on subjects like market authorisation for food additives, novel foods and genetically modified foods, food hygiene, tracking & tracing, withdrawal & recall. The powers of public authorities to enforce food law and to deal with incidents are outlined. Attention is given to the international context (WTO, Codex Alimentarius) as well as to private standards. In addition to the systematic analysis, the book includes selected topics such as nutrition and health policy, special foods, food import requirements, food contact materials, intellectual property and animal feed. The 'EU Food Law Handbook' is produced in co-operation with the European Institute for Food Law. It is relevant for practitioners and academics both with and without a background in law. It is ideal for education purposes.

This volume takes a look at the status quo of whistleblowing in several jurisdictions from around the world. Covering a topic that draws the attention of a broad public and is gaining importance amongst legislators, practitioners and scholars all over the globe, the book examines the various aspects of whistleblowing. It looks at what kind of legal protection of whistleblowers is in force, who is protected, what kind of behaviour is protected, and what kind of behaviour whistleblowers are protected against. This is achieved by a combination of a general comparative report with country-specific reports that give information on whistleblowing in various jurisdictions. These countries include, amongst others, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and the USA. A synopsis comprises information on whistleblowing in 23 countries in one tabula.

"One of the most prominent and urgent problems in international governance is how the different branches and norms of international law interact, and what to do in the event of conflict. With no single 'international legislator' and a multitude of states, international organisations and tribunals making and enforcing the law, the international legal system is decentralised. This leads to a wide variety of international norms, ranging from customary international law and general principles of law, to multilateral and bilateral treaties on trade, the environment, human rights, the law of the sea, etc. Pauwelyn provides a framework on how these different norms interact, focusing on the relationship between the law of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other rules of international law. He also examines the hierarchy of norms within the WTO treaty. His recurring theme is how to marry trade and non-trade rules, or economic and non-economic objectives, at the international level."--Jacket.

This book represents a first attempt to investigate the relations between Law and Agroecology. There is a need to adopt a transdisciplinary approach to multifunctional agriculture in order to integrate the agroecological paradigm in legal regulation. This does not require a super-law that hierarchically purports to incorporate and supplant the existing legal fields; rather, it calls for the creation of a trans-law that progressively works to coordinate interlegalities between different legal fields, respecting their autonomy but emphasizing their common historical roots in rus in the process. Rus, the rural phenomenon as a whole, reflects the plurality and interdependence of different complex systems based jointly on the land as a central point of reference. “Rural” is more than “agricultural”: if agriculture is understood traditionally as an activity aimed at exploiting the land for the production of material goods for use, consumption and private exchange, rurality marks the reintegration of agriculture into a broader sphere, one that is not only economic, but also social and cultural; not only material, but also ideal, relational, historical, and symbolic; and not only private, but also public. In approaching rus, the natural and social sciences first became specialized, multiplied, and compartmentalized in a plurality of first-order disciplines; later, they began a process of integration into Agroecology as a second-order, multi-perspective and shared research platform. Today, Agroecology is a transdiscipline that integrates other fields of knowledge into the concept of agroecosystems viewed as socio-ecological systems. However, the law seems to still be stuck in the first stage. Following a reductionist approach, law has deconstructed and shattered the universe of rus into countless, disjointed legal elementary particles, multiplying the planes of analysis and, in particular, keeping Agricultural Law and Environmental Law two separate fields.  .

[*] "This book is a comprehensive guide to the essentials that public managers need to know about administrative law-why we have administrative law, the constitutional constraints on public administration, and administrative law's frameworks for rulemaking, adjudication, enforcement, transparency, and judicial and legislative review. Rosenbloom views administrative law from the perspectives of administrative practice, emphasizing how various administrative law provisions promote their underlying goal of improving the fit between public administration and U.S. democratic-constitutionalism.

It has also been updated to include the major statutes, court cases, executive orders and other major executive initiatives since 2003. The addition of discussion questions makes this an even more valuable resource for public administration classrooms and students. Organized around federal administrative law, Administrative Law for Public Managers explains the fundamentals of administrative law clearly and accurately, in non-technical terms, and with sufficient depth to provide readers with a sophisticated, lasting understanding of the subject matter"-- "Modern legal systems are characterized by a tension between two commonplaces: the rule of law on the one hand, and the arguable character of law on the other. The rule of law calls for legal certainty, predictability and reasonableness; the argumentative character of law implies room for rational disagreement. In this book ... scholars come together to offer interdisciplinary approaches to debate this tension and its possible reconciliation. Central in their perspective is that reconciliation is possible when the rule of law also incorporates rules for reason-giving. Reason-giving should be part of a substantive conception of the rule of law. Requiring that legal decision-makers give reasons furthers reasonable outcomes. The analysis of the ideal of rational argumentation and the ideal of the rule of law show how insights of two traditions are connected. This collection of essays includes contributions from law, argumentation theory, logic and philosophical perspectives. This multifaceted approach demonstrates the variety of questions that emerge at the intersection of both commonplaces."--","[*] 1118420888 (ebk.)

[*] "This book considers an important and largely neglected area of Islamic law by exploring how medieval Muslim jurists resolved criminal cases that could not be proven beyond a doubt, calling into question a controversial popular notion about Islamic law today, which is that Islamic law is a divine legal tradition that has little room for discretion or doubt, particularly in Islamic criminal law. Despite its contemporary popularity, that notion turns out to have been far outside the mainstream of Islamic law for most of its history. Instead of rejecting doubt, medieval Muslim scholars largely embraced it. In fact, they used doubt to enlarge their own power and to construct Islamic criminal law itself. Through examination of legal, historical, and theological sources, and a range of illustrative case studies, this book shows that Muslim jurists developed a highly sophisticated and regulated system for dealing with Islam's unique concept of doubt, which evolved from the seventh to the sixteenth century"-- [*] "This book considers an important and largely neglected area of Islamic law by exploring how medieval Muslim jurists resolved criminal cases that could not be proven beyond a doubt"--","[*] 900178756 [*] 880960107 [*] 9781118591185 (ebk.)

Part C looks to the future, examining differences between civil law and common law and the impact of the European Union. "The rule of law has been celebrated as 'an unqualified human good,' yet there is considerable disagreement about what the ideal of the rule of law requires. When people clamor for the preservation or extension of the rule of law, are they advocating a substantive conception of the rule of law respecting private property and promoting liberty, a formal conception emphasizing an 'inner morality of law,' or a procedural conception stressing the right to be heard by an impartial tribunal and to make arguments about what the law is? When are exertions of executive power 'outside the law' justified on the ground that they may be necessary to maintain or restore the conditions for the rule of law in emergency circumstances, such as defending against terrorist attacks? In Getting to the Rule of Law a group of contributors from a variety of disciplines address many of the theoretical legal, political, and moral issues raised by such questions and examine practical applications 'on the ground' in the United States and around the world. This timely, interdisciplinary volume examines the ideal of the rule of law, questions when, if ever, executive power 'outside the law' is justified to maintain or restore the rule of law, and explores the prospects for and perils of building the rule of law after military interventions."--Publisher's description.","[*] 9780429679278 (Mobipocket ebook) [*] 9780814728444 (e-book) [*] 0814728448 (e-book) [*] 1033546702 [*] ^^2011012528 [*] 081472843X (cl : alk. paper) [*] 2018020860 [*] 708648750 [*] 9780814728437 (cl : alk. paper) [*] 9781351342810 (Mobipocket ebook) 1-78536-149-X","[*] English [*] ger [*] eng [*] fre [*] spa [*] ita","[*] 72 videocassettes: sd., col. ; 1/2 in. xii, 298 p. ; 22 cm.

This book examines the employment arrangements of professional athletes in the Premier League football competition, the National Basketball Association competition and rugby union played at an international level. It describes the organisation and regulatory frameworks of these three professional team sports and highlights the legal, economic and regulatory factors that influence the final form of an athlete’s working conditions. It provides a comparative analysis between the sports on issues such as the role of collective bargaining, wage regulation, salary caps, nationality restrictions, eligibility, player movement and the acquisition of a player’s intellectual property. It discusses the approaches adopted in each sport for balancing the interests of labour and management, the problem of controlling private regulatory power in professional sport, and considers the extent to which legal or government intervention is required in an athlete’s employment relationship. National law can assist players in a domestic league to secure an involvement in the determination of working conditions but it has a more limited effect in a competition organised by an international governing body. This book argues that social regulation through soft law processes at an international level may benefit athletes, consumers and sport globally. It provides a useful case example for comparison with the organisation of other professional team sports in Europe, North America and Australasia. This book is important reading for scholars and practitioners in the fields of international sports law, employment law, competition law, European law and human rights law. It is also highly recommended for students at undergraduate and postgraduate levels taking modules and courses in Sports Law or Sports Business Management. Dr. Leanne O’Leary is a dual-qualified solicitor, Senior Lecturer in Law and member of the Centre for Sports Law Research at Edge Hill University in the United Kingdom.

[*] "This book assesses how international law and its institutions may be relevant and influence the course of international relations, in other words the relationship between power and law. This is done in relation to five regimes; international trade, environmental protection, human rights, criminal justice and use of force.The majority of international law literature focuses on the content of international rules (i.e. regimes) but has a tendency to ignore why these regimes exist and to what extent the rules actually affect state behaviour. The assumption is that states follow international law when the reality sometimes tells us differently. Turning to international relations literature, some scholars as represented in their publications focus on theories based on the distribution of power among states and ignore the existence and relevance of international law. In contrast, Power and Law in International Society examines theories of international relations, international law and formal institutions as well as an account of empirical research on the relevance of international law for the behaviour of states.This book has three main themes. First, the book will explain the foundations of international society from an inter-disciplinary perspective relaying on legal studies as well as international relations.

It describes the organisation and regulatory frameworks of these three professional team sports and highlights the legal, economic and regulatory factors that influence the final form of an athlete’s working conditions. It provides a comparative analysis between the sports on issues such as the role of collective bargaining, wage regulation, salary caps, nationality restrictions, eligibility, player movement and the acquisition of a player’s intellectual property. It discusses the approaches adopted in each sport for balancing the interests of labour and management, the problem of controlling private regulatory power in professional sport, and considers the extent to which legal or government intervention is required in an athlete’s employment relationship. National law can assist players in a domestic league to secure an involvement in the determination of working conditions but it has a more limited effect in a competition organised by an international governing body. This book argues that social regulation through soft law processes at an international level may benefit athletes, consumers and sport globally. It provides a useful case example for comparison with the organisation of other professional team sports in Europe, North America and Australasia. This book is important reading for scholars and practitioners in the fields of international sports law, employment law, competition law, European law and human rights law. It is also highly recommended for students at undergraduate and postgraduate levels taking modules and courses in Sports Law or Sports Business Management. Dr. Leanne O’Leary is a dual-qualified solicitor, Senior Lecturer in Law and member of the Centre for Sports Law Research at Edge Hill University in the United Kingdom. This book appears in the ASSER International Sports Law Series, under the editorship of Prof. Dr. Ben Van Rompuy and Dr. Antoine Duval.","[*] 9780429679278 (Mobipocket ebook) [*] 9781138804609 [*] 1033546702 [*] ^^2014042471 [*] 2018020860 [*] 1138804606 [*] 9781351342810 (Mobipocket ebook) [*] 1315752093 [*] 885226514 1-78536-149-X [*] 9781315752099","[*] English [*] ger [*] eng [*] fre [*] spa [*] ita","xvi, 182 pages ; 24 cm.

It explores the field through specific approaches to its study, within specific legal systems, and within discrete sub-fields of civil procedure. The book reflects the latest research and conveys the dynamism and innovations of modern civil procedure - by field, method and system. The book’s introductory chapters lay the groundwork for researchers to appreciate the flux and change within the field. The concluding chapters bring the many different identified innovations and developments together to show the field's ability to adapt to modern circumstances, while retaining its coherence even across different legal systems, traditions, fields and analytic approaches.  Specifically, in this book the presence of dynamism is explored in the legal systems of the EU, France, the US, Brazil, Australia, the UK and China. So too that dynamism  is explored in the contributions’ analyses and discussions of the changes or need for change of specific aspects of civil procedure including litigation costs, class actions, derivative actions, pleadings, and res judicata. Furthermore, most of the individual contributions may be considered to be comparative analyses of their respective subjects and, when considered as a whole, the book presents the dynamism of civil procedure in comparative perspective. Those discrete and aggregated comparative analyses permit us to better understand the dynamism in civil procedure – for change in the abstract can be less visible and its significance and impact less evident. While similar conclusions may have been drawn through examinations in isolation, employing comparative analytic methods provided a richer analysis and any identified need for change is correspondingly advanced through comparative analysis. Furthermore, if that analysis leads to a conclusion that change is necessary then comparative law may provide pertinent examples for such change - as well as methodologies for successfully transplanting any such changes. In other words, as this book so well reflects, comparative law may itself usefully contribute to dynamism in civil procedure. This has long been a raison d'être of comparative law and, as clear from this book’s contributions, in this particular time and field of study we find that it is very likely to achieve its lofty promise.","[*] 9780429679278 (Mobipocket ebook) [*] 3-319-21981-2 [*] 1033546702 [*] ^^2014042471 [*] 10.1007/978-3-319-21981-3 [*] 2018020860 [*] 9781351342810 (Mobipocket ebook) [*] 1315752093 [*] 885226514 1-78536-149-X [*] 9781315752099","[*] English [*] ger [*] eng [*] fre [*] spa [*] ita","[*] 72 videocassettes: sd., col. ; 1/2 in.

Out of this upheaval came the Western idea of integrated legal systems consciously developed over generations and centuries. Harold J. Berman describes the main features of these systems of law, including the canon law of the church, the royal law of the major kingdoms, the urban law of the newly emerging cities, feudal law, manorial law, and mercantile law. In the coexistence and competition of these systems he finds an important source of the Western belief in the supremacy of law.","[*] 9780429679278 (Mobipocket ebook) [*] 0674517741 [*] ^^^82015747^ [*] 9780674517745 [*] 2018020860 [*] 8827871 [*] 0674517768 [*] 9781351342810 (Mobipocket ebook) [*] 1033546702 1-78536-149-X [*] 9780674517769","[*] English [*] ger [*] eng [*] fre [*] spa [*] ita","[*] 72 videocassettes: sd., col. ; 1/2 in.

"In addition to in-depth descriptions of all the problems that beset our planet's air, soil, water, wildlife, polar regions, and atmosphere - and the protection of these environmental elements under international, regional, and national legal instruments - this book examines the complex issues that lie at the heart of environmental law practice: liability, enforcement, compliance, due diligence, procedural obligations, performance standards, criminal sanctions, "debt-for-nature swaps", economic incentives and disincentives, reparation, dispute settlement, the powerful presence of the international trade regime, and many others. Some of the book's most revealing insights are to be found in its comparison of the authority and effectiveness of different approaches to common problems, such as the environmental laws and policies of Germany and the United States, and those contained in the European Union's environmental regime and the environmental side agreements to NAFTA."

First, the book will explain the foundations of international society from an inter-disciplinary perspective relaying on legal studies as well as international relations. Second, the book will examine variations in the degree of legalization in terms of obligation, precision, delegation and state acceptance. Finally, the book will give an account of the empirical research on the relevance of international law for the behaviour of states. This book will be of great interest to scholars of international law and international relations"-- "This book - which is simultaneously a treatise on international environmental law, a comparative study of American and European approaches to environmental legal issues, and a deliberate integration of the various "branches" of environmental law into a new synthesis more suited to current and emerging realities - represents a cooperative achievement of two groups, American and German." "In addition to in-depth descriptions of all the problems that beset our planet's air, soil, water, wildlife, polar regions, and atmosphere - and the protection of these environmental elements under international, regional, and national legal instruments - this book examines the complex issues that lie at the heart of environmental law practice: liability, enforcement, compliance, due diligence, procedural obligations, performance standards, criminal sanctions, "debt-for-nature swaps", economic incentives and disincentives, reparation, dispute settlement, the powerful presence of the international trade regime, and many others. Some of the book's most revealing insights are to be found in its comparison of the authority and effectiveness of different approaches to common problems, such as the environmental laws and policies of Germany and the United States, and those contained in the European Union's environmental regime and the environmental side agreements to NAFTA." "Anyone with an interest in environmental law, from a beginning student to an experienced activist, corporate counsel, or policymaker, will find this book to be of value and usefulness."--BOOK JACKET.","[*] 9780429679278 (Mobipocket ebook) [*] 9041188452 (Regular ed.)

This book will be of great interest to scholars of international law and international relations"-- It has been a major contention of classical natural law theory that the arguments it makes, because rooted in a robust account of human nature, are of universal applicability. In consequence, although the disciplines of natural law and comparative law have long tended to be treated as essentially immiscible, there is reason to believe that this may not be the whole story and that an exploration of how they can be brought together holds out the promise of making real theoretical advances in each. It is in this spirit that the present volume collects together essays from a variety of scholars with interests in various aspects of classical natural law theory and comparative legal studies as a way of beginning what the editors hope will become a fruitful and, in time, much wider conversation.--","[*] 9780429679278 (Mobipocket ebook) [*] 9780854901548 [*] 085490154X [*] ^^^82015747^ [*] 2018020860 [*] 8827871 [*] 43936940 84174038 [*] 9781351342810 (Mobipocket ebook) [*] 1033546702 [*] 903482236","[*] English [*] ger [*] eng [*] fre [*] spa [*] ita","[*] 72 videocassettes: sd., col. ; 1/2 in.

The book offers a comparison of the CESL with the CISG, as well as pre-existing instruments, including the Draft Common Frame of Reference (DCFR) and the Principles of European Contract Law (PECL). It analyses the process of enactment of CESL and its scope of application, covering areas such as the sale of goods, the supplying (licensing) of digital content, the supply of trade-related services, and consumer protection. It examines the design of the CESL bifurcating businesses into large and small-to-medium sized enterprises, and the providing of rules covering digital content and the supply of trade-related services. Lastly, it studies the field of application of the CESL combined with the already existing EU consumer protection laws, as well as nation-specific laws.

It is unique in identifying the factors that determine a law school's academic quality and in recounting the activities of the ABA and AALS in assuring adequate funding to maintain academic standards"-- This book critically evaluates the current copyright law system in a digital environment from a comparative perspective. Since many developing countries modelled their copyright laws on more advanced jurisdictions, they have not benefitted from such a law as much as intended due to their inherently embedded social economic conditions. Moreover, the copyright law system has been under constant challenges from rapidly developing digital technology and the Internet. All in all, there is a pressing need for developing countries to reevaluate their copyright law in light of their national needs, the developmental stage of their economy, their culture and tradition, and their legal system. The book poses the question of whether copyright law should be reformed to fulfill its fundamental purpose of serving education and research that are in the public interest in the digital era? It examines whether the legal frameworks adequately address developing countries’ educational and research requirements in view of the opportunities and restrictions posed by electronic communication media. Further, it provides a comprehensive study that addresses the various critical issues relevant to the reform of the copyright law system and offers recommendations for developing countries to revamp their copyright law system to better serve their education and research sector.

This book brings together a wide range of data protection perspectives from different African countries. It presents analyses of data protection systems of selected jurisdictions with data protection legislation in Africa, as well as countries without comprehensive data protection laws. The book canvasses data privacy law in the major legal systems in Africa: common and civil law. It also covers the South African mixed legal system. In addition, the book covers all sub-regional and regional data privacy policies in Africa. Apart from analysing data protection law, the book focuses on the socio-economic contexts, political settings and legal culture in which such laws developed and operate. It bases its analyses on the African legal culture and comparative international data privacy law. In Africa protection of personal data, the central preoccupation of data privacy laws, is on the policy agenda. The recently adopted African Union Cyber Security and Data Protection Convention 2014, which is the first and currently the only single treaty across the globe to address data protection outside Europe, serves as an illustration of such interest. In addition, there are data protection frameworks at sub-regional levels for West Africa, East Africa and Southern Africa. Similarly, laws on protection of personal data are increasingly being adopted at national plane. Yet despite these data privacy law reforms there is scant literature about data privacy law in Africa and its recent developments. This book fills that gap.

International Food Law and Policy is the first interdisciplinary piece of academic literature of its kind with a comprehensive, reader-friendly approach to teaching the major aspects of food regulation, law, policy, food safety and environmental sustainability in a global context.  The sections are grouped by continents and focus on a range of cross-disciplinary subjects, such as public health, international food trade, the right to food, intellectual property and global regulatory aspects of food production. With its systematic approach, this book will be a valuable resource both for professionals working in food regulation and  anyone interested in the subject. It provides a solid foundation for courses and master’s programs in environmental management, food law, policy and regulation, and sustainable development around the world.

This book analyzes issues in human rights law from a variety of perspectives by eminent European and Asian professors of constitutional law, international public law, and European Union law. As a result, their contributions collected here illustrate the phenomenon of cross-fertilization not only in Europe (the EU and its member states and the Council of Europe), but also between Europe and Asia. Furthermore, it reveals the influence that national and foreign law, EU law and the European Convention on Human Rights, and European and Asian law exert over one another. The various chapters cover general fundamental rights and human rights issues in Europe and Asia as well as specific topics regarding the principles of nondiscrimination, women’s rights, the right to freedom of speech in Japan, and China’s Development Banks in Asia. Protection of human rights should be guaranteed in the international community, and research based on a comparative law approach is useful for the protection of human rights at a higher level. As the product of academic cooperation between ten professors of Japanese, Taiwanese, German, Italian, and Belgian nationalities, this work responds to such needs.","[*] 9780429679278 (Mobipocket ebook) [*] 131578064X (ebk.)

Andrew Hambler identifies principled responses to workplace religious expression with a liberal state and compares this to the state of the law in England and Wales at a court and tribunal level. The book determines the extent to which freedom of religious expression for the individual enjoys legal protection in the workplace in England and Wales, and asks whether there is a case for changing the law to strengthen that protection. The book will be of great use and interest to scholars and students of religion and the law, employment law, and religion and human rights"-- [*] "The focus throughout is on private law, particularly the civil laws of France and Germany, except where European Community law has made inroads into the (private) civil law. Each chapter thus incorporates the relevant materials on European Community law."-- Publisher description. This accessible and incisive research review discusses a collection of formative and influential scholarship in a particularly dynamic area of legal development and social change: the role of gender within constitutional law. It features theoretical, empirical, and practical analyses from leading scholars, judges, and nongovernmental organizations around the world. The review is transnational and comparative in range and representative in scope, with particular attention paid to intersectionality, culture and custom. Written by an internationally renowned scholar, lawyer and activist, this review is an essential research tool for libraries, academic institutions, scholars and students alike. [*] "The role of religion in various domains of the public sphere provokes much debate. One of the key areas where this debate is unfolding is in the secular workplace, where some employees strongly desire to express their religious beliefs in ways which may bring them into conflict with their employers. For example, a Sikh woman may wish to wear a kara bracelet contrary to an employers uniform policy; or a Muslim may wish to take time out of required working hours for Friday prayers. Equally, some employees may feel compelled to object to particular aspects of their job role from which a crisis of conscience arises. For instance, a Christian registrar might object to registering a same-sex marriage or civil partnership; or a Muslim retail worker might object to handling alcohol.This addresses these conflicts and the role of law in resolving them. It considers what is meant by religious expression by individual employees, and the motives underlying it, and sets out the different ways it might have an impact on the workplace, in both uncontroversial and potentially controversial ways. The book identifies different principled responses to workplace religious expression within a liberal state. It then goes on to analyse to what extent the law in England and Wales reflects these differing responses, both at a legislative and policy level, and at a court and tribunal level. The book determines the extent to which freedom of religious expression for the individual enjoys legal protection in the workplace in England and Wales, and whether or not there is a case for changing the law to strengthen that protection"--","[*] 9780429679278 (Mobipocket ebook) [*] 131578064X (ebk.) 1-78536-940-7 [*] 981-10-6129-7 [*] 2018020860 [*] 868199843 [*] 10.1007/978-981-10-6129-5 [*] 10.1007/978-3-319-47317-8 [*] 9781351342810 (Mobipocket ebook) [*] 1033546702 [*] ^^2014019862","[*] English [*] ger [*] eng [*] fre [*] spa [*] ita","[*] 72 videocassettes: sd., col. ; 1/2 in.

"This book examines the effect of the adoption of the United Nations Committee on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency in five common law jurisdictions, namely Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. It examines how each of those states has adopted, interpreted and applied the provisions of the Model Law, and highlights the effects of inconsistencies by examining jurisprudence in each of these countries, specifically how the Model Law affects existing principles of recognition of insolvency proceedings. The book examines how the UNCITRAL Guide to enactment of the Model Law has affected the interpretation of each of its articles and, in turn, the courts' ability to interpret and hence give effect to the purposes of the Model Law. It also considers the ability of courts to refer to amendments made to the Guide after enactment of the Model Law in a state, thereby questioning whether the current inconsistencies in interpretation can be overcome by UNCITRAL amending the Guide"--Back cover.

For reasons of effectiveness, efficiency and equity, Australian law reform should be planned carefully. Academics can and should take the lead in this process. This book collects over 50 discrete law reform recommendations, encapsulated in short, digestible essays written by leading Australian scholars. It emerges from a major conference held at The Australian National University in 2016, which featured intensive discussion among participants from government, practice and the academy. The book is intended to serve as a national focal point for Australian legal innovation. It is divided into six main parts: commercial and corporate law, criminal law and evidence, environmental law, private law, public law, and legal practice and legal education. In addition, Indigenous perspectives on law reform are embedded throughout each part. This collective work--the first of its kind--will be of value to policy makers, media, law reform agencies, academics, practitioners and the judiciary. It provides a bird's eye view of the current state and the future of law reform in Australia. [*] "The role of religion in various domains of the public sphere provokes much debate.

U.S. presidents, Supreme Court justices, and foreign heads of state, along with senators,congressional representatives, social critics, civil rights activists, university presidents, state and federal judges,military generals, novelists, spies, Olympians, film and TV producers, CEOs, and one First Lady have graduated from the school since its founding in 1817. During its first century, Harvard Law School pioneered revolutionary educational ideas, including professional legal education within a university, Socratic questioning and case analysis, and the admission and training of students based on academic merit. But the school struggled to navigate its way through the many political, social, economic, and legal crises of the century, and it earned both scars and plaudits as a result. On the Battlefield of Merit offers a candid, critical, definitive account of a unique legal institution during its first century of influence. Daniel R. Coquillette and Bruce A. Kimball examine the school's ties with institutional slavery, its buffeting between Federalists and Republicans, its deep involvement in the Civil War, its reluctance to admit minorities and women, its anti-Catholicism, and its financial missteps at the turn of the twentieth century. On the Battlefield of Merits brings the story of Harvard Law School up to 1909 - a time when hard-earned accomplishment led to self-satisfaction and vulnerabilities that would ultimately challenge its position as the leading law school in the nation. A second volume will continue this history through the twentieth century"--Unedited summary from book jacket.

"The relationship between environmentally sustainable development and company law and related areas of business law and policy has emerged in recent years as a matter of major concern for many scholars, policy-makers, businesses and nongovernmental organisations. This book combines a conceptual analysis of the principles of sustainable development and environmental integration in the EU legal system with a particular focus on Article 11 TFEU and its impact on business in the EU. Article 11 TFEU states that European Union policies and activities must integrate environmental protection requirements with an emphasis on promoting sustainable development and the book investigates the role played by Article 11 TFEU in specific areas of EU law affecting European businesses.The book gives an overview of the role played by the environmental integration principle in EU law, both at the level of European legislation and at the level of Member State practice. It explores a number of issues related to the role played by Article 11 TFEU in the EU legal system, including its history, its function in the Treaties and its significance for EU institutions and Member States. Contributors to the volume identify and analyse the main legal issues related to the importance of Article 11 TFEU in various policy areas of EU law affecting European businesses, such as company law, insurance and state aid. In drawing together these strands the book sets out what the requirement of environmental integration means for the regulation of business in the EU"-- [*] "The workplace is a key area where the issue of religion and its position in the public sphere is under debate.

The book determines the extent to which freedom of religious expression for the individual enjoys legal protection in the workplace in England and Wales, and asks whether there is a case for changing the law to strengthen that protection. The book will be of great use and interest to scholars and students of religion and the law, employment law, and religion and human rights"-- [*] "The role of religion in various domains of the public sphere provokes much debate. One of the key areas where this debate is unfolding is in the secular workplace, where some employees strongly desire to express their religious beliefs in ways which may bring them into conflict with their employers. For example, a Sikh woman may wish to wear a kara bracelet contrary to an employers uniform policy; or a Muslim may wish to take time out of required working hours for Friday prayers. Equally, some employees may feel compelled to object to particular aspects of their job role from which a crisis of conscience arises. For instance, a Christian registrar might object to registering a same-sex marriage or civil partnership; or a Muslim retail worker might object to handling alcohol.This addresses these conflicts and the role of law in resolving them. It considers what is meant by religious expression by individual employees, and the motives underlying it, and sets out the different ways it might have an impact on the workplace, in both uncontroversial and potentially controversial ways. The book identifies different principled responses to workplace religious expression within a liberal state. It then goes on to analyse to what extent the law in England and Wales reflects these differing responses, both at a legislative and policy level, and at a court and tribunal level. The book determines the extent to which freedom of religious expression for the individual enjoys legal protection in the workplace in England and Wales, and whether or not there is a case for changing the law to strengthen that protection"--","[*] 9780429679278 (Mobipocket ebook) [*] ^^2014024748 [*] Business Manager, Indiana Law Journal, Indiana University School of Law, Law Bldg., Room 009, Bloomington, Ind. 47405 1-78536-940-7 [*] 862102696 [*] 9781315767864 (ebk) [*] 2018020860 [*] 1138019569 (hardback) [*] 9781351342810 (Mobipocket ebook) [*] 9781138019560 (hardback) [*] 1033546702","[*] English [*] ger [*] eng [*] lat [*] spa [*] ita","[*] 1 sound disc: digital; 4 3/4 in.

This book combines a conceptual analysis of the principles of sustainable development and environmental integration in the EU legal system with a particular focus on Article 11 TFEU and its impact on business in the EU. Article 11 TFEU states that European Union policies and activities must integrate environmental protection requirements with an emphasis on promoting sustainable development and the book investigates the role played by Article 11 TFEU in specific areas of EU law affecting European businesses.The book gives an overview of the role played by the environmental integration principle in EU law, both at the level of European legislation and at the level of Member State practice. It explores a number of issues related to the role played by Article 11 TFEU in the EU legal system, including its history, its function in the Treaties and its significance for EU institutions and Member States. Contributors to the volume identify and analyse the main legal issues related to the importance of Article 11 TFEU in various policy areas of EU law affecting European businesses, such as company law, insurance and state aid. In drawing together these strands the book sets out what the requirement of environmental integration means for the regulation of business in the EU"-- [*] "In this era of globalisation, different legal systems and structures no longer operate within their own jurisdictions.

It was written by attorneys involved in the daily practice of business law in Germany and is aimed at people who wish to orient themselves quickly with the German legal system and the manner in which it impacts business purchases, establishment, operations and liquidations. The first section of the book is devoted to an explanation of the major issues to be considered in acquiring or establishing a business in Germany. The second section focuses on areas of commercial law that are important for an operating business. The following sections deal with labor law as an independent part of German business law and with computer law. Furthermore, procedural law and European law are addressed. Finally, the last two sections of the book are devoted to an overview over the German tax law, which has an enormous impact on business decisions, and IP law. In all sections special attention has been paid to highlighting and explaining the differences between the German legal system and that of the United States. Nevertheless, the intention is to provide information that will prove valuable to all foreigners, particularly business men and women and lawyers advising clients with an interest in doing business in Germany.

Law, over the course of American history, has reflected the changing cultural settings in which legal decisions have been made, and has helped shape those settings.

Those concerns centered on the structural and functional efficacy of the form of federal government created by the Articles of Confederation in 1781, and were a product of a particular set of historical experiences. But once the Constitution was drafted and ratified, an authoritative legal document had recast the form and structure of American government, providing a framework into which future political, economic, social, and intellectual issues would be set. As the example suggests, law has not been only a cultural artifact in the history of American civilization, but also a causal agent in the unfolding of that history"-- [*] For instance, a series of decisions by the Marshall court essentially marginalized Amerindians, indigenous people of the Americas, reducing tribes to wards of the government. Likewise, law initially legitimated slavery in the United States, and legal institutions, including the Supreme Court, failed to resolve the tensions stirred up by the westward expansion of slavery, eventually sparking the Civil War. White also looks at the expansion of laws regarding property rights, which were vitally important to the colonists, many of whom left Europe hoping to become land owners; the evolution of criminal punishment from a public display (the stocks, the gallows) to a private prison system; the rise of tort law after the Civil War; and the progress in legal education, moving from informal apprenticeships and lax standards to modern law schools and rigorous bar exams.

Even though we disagree about what the rule of law means, we all seem to agree that it is a worthy goal, to which any good legal system should aspire. Yet, some argue that this is not enough; that the rule of law is too important to be left in the realm of politics, and must be protected by legal means. References to the rule of law now appear, with apparently increasing frequency, in case law from across the common law world. In some countries, it has been claimed that the government can never validly act in a way that is contrary to the rule of law. The position in Australia remains unclear. There is no mention of the rule of law in our constitutional text - but in the Communist Party Case, Dixon J said that the rule of law 'forms an assumption' of the Australian Constitution. This statement has often been repeated, but never properly analysed. Taking Dixon J's statement as its starting point, this book examines the extent to which the rule of law is protected and promoted by the Australian Constitution - indeed, how the complex and contested concept of the rule of law should be understood within the Australian constitutional order. This ... book combines theoretical analysis of the concept of the rule of law and constitutionalism with doctrinal analysis of the case law of the Australian High Court. It examines the nature and limits of legislative, executive and judicial power, and so should appeal to constitutional and administrative lawyers, scholars and practitioners. The book adds an Australian voice to global debates and a novel perspective on that enduring question of how to create 'a government of laws rather than of men'."-- [*] "Law has played a central role in American history.

Even though we disagree about what the rule of law means, we all seem to agree that it is a worthy goal, to which any good legal system should aspire. Yet, some argue that this is not enough; that the rule of law is too important to be left in the realm of politics, and must be protected by legal means. References to the rule of law now appear, with apparently increasing frequency, in case law from across the common law world. In some countries, it has been claimed that the government can never validly act in a way that is contrary to the rule of law. The position in Australia remains unclear. There is no mention of the rule of law in our constitutional text - but in the Communist Party Case, Dixon J said that the rule of law 'forms an assumption' of the Australian Constitution. This statement has often been repeated, but never properly analysed. Taking Dixon J's statement as its starting point, this book examines the extent to which the rule of law is protected and promoted by the Australian Constitution - indeed, how the complex and contested concept of the rule of law should be understood within the Australian constitutional order. This ... book combines theoretical analysis of the concept of the rule of law and constitutionalism with doctrinal analysis of the case law of the Australian High Court. It examines the nature and limits of legislative, executive and judicial power, and so should appeal to constitutional and administrative lawyers, scholars and practitioners. The book adds an Australian voice to global debates and a novel perspective on that enduring question of how to create 'a government of laws rather than of men'."-- [*] "Law has played a central role in American history. From colonial times to the present, law has not just reflected the changing society in which legal decisions have been made-it has played a powerful role in shaping that society, though not always in positive ways. In this Very Short Introduction, eminent legal scholar G. Edward White-author of the ongoing, multi-volume Law in American History-offers a compact overview that sheds light on the impact of law on a number of key social issues. Rather than offer a straight chronological history, the book instead traces important threads woven throughout our nation's past, looking at how law shaped Native American affairs, slavery, business, and home life, as well as how it has dealt with criminal and civil offenses.

The work is deliberately crafted to address the lack of a comprehensive resource on the subject, and guide lawyers, policy-makers, Community citizens, researchers, students and civil society organisations through the labyrinth of the Community's laws and policies. From a socio-legal perspective, it unearths political, socio-economic and legal structures that impinge on the integration cause on the one hand, and dilute the efficacy of the Community legal regime on the other hand. Also, it exposes contemporary terrorism and conflict in West Africa and the legal interventions that the Community has adopted to respond to these challenges. In sequence, it traces and expounds the legal development of the Community norms with respect to sources of law, human rights, supra-nationalism and laws of the member states, reference procedure, action for damages, freedom of movement, discrimination and competition policy. The book particularly evaluates the extent of the human rights jurisdiction of the Community Court of Justice, as well as jurisdictional limitations to the protection of Community rights either at national or Community level. Also, it sheds light on the jurisdictional chasm existing between Community law and member states' national laws, and offers proven constitutional, legislative and judicial solutions to plug the gap. It explains vividly the common market, free movement of goods and the impact of Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) on the entire ECOWAS free trade policy. In all these analyses, evaluation and examination of norms and policies, the work draws on the European Union's rich case law on similar points to explain recondite issues of law which may arise or have arisen from the application of any of the ECOWAS texts.

This publication provides an unparalleled comparative analysis of two "hot topics" in the field of antitrust and unfair competition law with regard to a number of key countries. The first part of the book examines the prohibition of abuse of a dominant position and globalization in relation to two broad questions: first, whether there is consistency between the approaches of different jurisdictions to the notion of abuse, and, second, whether there are too many restrictions on legal rights and business opportunities resulting from the prohibition of abuse of dominance. The international report drafted by Professor Pinar Akman reveals that there are as many similarities as differences between the approaches of the twenty-one jurisdictions studied and presented in this book. This is an invitation to read the excellent international report as well as the reports on specific jurisdictions in order to grasp the variety of arguments and approaches of this antitrust area, which may, on the surface, appear alike. The second part gathers contributions on the question of protection and disclosure of trade secrets and know-how from various jurisdictions. The need for adequate protection of trade secrets has increased due to digitalization and the ease with which large volumes of misappropriated information can be reproduced. The comprehensive international report, prepared by Henrik Bengtsson, brings together these reflections by comparing various national positions. The book also discusses the resolutions passed by the General Assembly of the International League of Competition Law (LIDC) following a debate on each of these topics, and includes proposed solutions and recommendations.

It examines a range of themes from the viewpoint of identificable traditions such as Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism, from a theoretical and practical perspective. Among the themes discussed are the cross-over between religious and secular values and assumptions in the search for a just jurisprudence for women, the application of theological insights from religious traditions to legal issues at the core of feminist work, feminist legal readings of scriptural texts on women's rights, and the place that religious law has assigned to women in ecclesiastic life." - back cover.","[*] 140944421X (paperback : alk. paper) 1-78536-940-7 [*] 1033546702 [*] 9781409444213 (paperback : alk. paper) [*] 9781409444190 (hardcover : alk. paper) [*] 819816676 [*] 9781409474814 (ebook PUB) [*] 140947481X (ebook PUB) [*] 9781409444206 (ebook PDF) [*] 1409444198 (hardcover : alk. paper) [*] ^^2012048044","[*] ara [*] English [*] ger [*] eng [*] spa [*] ita","[*] 1 sound disc: digital; 4 3/4 in.

From colonial times to the present, law has not just reflected the changing society in which legal decisions have been made-it has played a powerful role in shaping that society, though not always in positive ways. In this Very Short Introduction, eminent legal scholar G. Edward White-author of the ongoing, multi-volume Law in American History-offers a compact overview that sheds light on the impact of law on a number of key social issues. Rather than offer a straight chronological history, the book instead traces important threads woven throughout our nation's past, looking at how law shaped Native American affairs, slavery, business, and home life, as well as how it has dealt with criminal and civil offenses. White shows that law has not always been used to exemplary ends. "This work aims to consider the influence of human rights and humanitarian law on general international law: the humanization of international law. Although human rights and humanitarian norms are central to the book, it is not a book about human rights and humanitarian law. Rather, it deals with the radiation, or the reforming effect, that human rights and humanitarian law have had on other fields of public international law. Because of the peculiarities of human rights law, this influence cannot be taken for granted. It is sometimes said that the elaboration of human rights norms and institutions has produced no less than a revolution in the system of international law. Is this true and if so in which parts of international law? By examining most areas of public international law, the author attempts to demonstrate that the influence of human rights and humanitarian norms has not remained confined to one sector of international law, but that its influence has spread to many parts, albeit to varying degrees." "The Humanization of International Law is a revised and expanded version of the General Course on Public International Law delivered by the author at the Hague Academy of International Law in 2003."--BOOK JACKET. [*] In this illuminating look at the pivotal role of law in American life, White offers us an excellent first step to a better appreciation of the function of law in our society. About the Series: Oxford's Very Short Introductions series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible. Not simply a textbook of definitions, each volume in this series provides trenchant and provocative--yet always balanced and complete--discussions of the central issues in a given discipline or field. Every Very Short Introduction gives a readable evolution of the subject in question, demonstrating how the subject has developed and how it has influenced society. Eventually, the series will encompass every major academic discipline, offering all students an accessible and abundant reference library. [*] ""Law," in this book, includes basic common law subjects (such as property, torts, and contracts), as well as statutory and constitutional issues, including issues associated with gender, race, and domestic relations. The domain of law also includes foundational issues of American political and social theory, such as sovereignty, liberty, equality, and criminal justice. It includes the evolving status and roles of members of the legal profession as influential figures in American culture. Understanding the importance of law in American society begins with recognition of the multiple dimensions of "legal" activity. Law, over the course of American history, has reflected the changing cultural settings in which legal decisions have been made, and has helped shape those settings. The Constitution of the United States was drafted in response to a set of political, economic, social, and intellectual concerns held by some late eighteenth-century Americans. Those concerns centered on the structural and functional efficacy of the form of federal government created by the Articles of Confederation in 1781, and were a product of a particular set of historical experiences. But once the Constitution was drafted and ratified, an authoritative legal document had recast the form and structure of American government, providing a framework into which future political, economic, social, and intellectual issues would be set. As the example suggests, law has not been only a cultural artifact in the history of American civilization, but also a causal agent in the unfolding of that history"-- [*] For instance, a series of decisions by the Marshall court essentially marginalized Amerindians, indigenous people of the Americas, reducing tribes to wards of the government. Likewise, law initially legitimated slavery in the United States, and legal institutions, including the Supreme Court, failed to resolve the tensions stirred up by the westward expansion of slavery, eventually sparking the Civil War. White also looks at the expansion of laws regarding property rights, which were vitally important to the colonists, many of whom left Europe hoping to become land owners; the evolution of criminal punishment from a public display (the stocks, the gallows) to a private prison system; the rise of tort law after the Civil War; and the progress in legal education, moving from informal apprenticeships and lax standards to modern law schools and rigorous bar exams.

This book develops an alternative approach to conventional Aboriginal title doctrine. It explains that aboriginal customary law can be a source of common law title to land in former British colonies, whether they were acquired by settlement or by conquest or cession from another colonising power. The doctrine of Common Law Aboriginal Customary Title provides a coherent approach to the source, content, proof and protection of Aboriginal land rights which overcomes problems arising from the law as currently understood and leads to more just results. The doctrine's applicability in Australia, Canada and South Africa is specifically demonstrated. While the jurisprudential underpinnings for the doctrine are consistent with fundamental common law principles, the author explains that the Australian High Court's decision in Mabo provides a broader basis for the doctrine: a broader basis which is consistent with a re-evaluation of case-law from former British colonies in Africa, as well as from the United States, New Zealand and Canada. In this context, the book proffers a reconceptualisation of the Crown's title to land in former colonies and a reassessment of conventional doctrines, including the doctrine of tenure and the doctrine of continuity.

Do international criminal tribunals regard both traditional elements of customary international law (State practice and opinio iuris) as necessary elements for the establishment of customary international law? Do international criminal tribunals argue along the lines of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), requiring a high frequency and consistency of State practice that is both 'extensive and virtually uniform?'

These essays, each written in the official language chosen by the authors, provide a critical perspective on Canada's past and present in international law, survey the challenges that lie before us and offer renewed focus for Canada's pursuit of global justice and the rule of law.

Part II explores Canada's role in international law, governance and innovation in the broad fields of international economic, environmental and intellectual property law. Economic law topics include international trade and investment, dispute settlement, subnational treaty making, international taxation and private international law. Environmental law topics include the international climate change regime and international treaties on chemicals and waste, transboundary water governance and the law of the sea. Intellectual property law topics explore the development of international IP protection and the integration of IP law into the body of international trade law.

It examines society and legal practice in Europe from the Middle Ages to the present from both a legal and a sociological perspective. The contributing authors investigate various aspects of succession law that have not yet been thoroughly examined by legal historians, and in doing so they not only add to our knowledge of past succession law but also provide a valuable key to interpreting and understanding current European succession law. Readers can explore such issues as the importance of a father’s permission to marry in relation to disinheritance, as well as inheritance transactions and private, dynastic and cross-border successions. Further themes addressed by the expert contributors include women’s inheritance rights, the laws of succession for the prince in legal consulting, and succession in the Rota Romana’s jurisprudence.","[*] 795687232 1-78536-940-7 [*] 1043026734 [*] ^^2012024125 [*] 1033546702 [*] 819816676 [*] on1043026734 [*] 10.1007/978-3-319-76258-6 [*] 140947481X (ebook PUB) [*] ^^2012048044 [*] 9783319762586 (ebk.)","[*] English [*] ger [*] eng [*] fre [*] spa [*] ita","[*] 1 sound disc: digital; 4 3/4 in.

This book examines these three challenges from a methodological standpoint. It addresses the first two by demonstrating that legal sociology has much to say about justice as a kind of social experience and has always engaged theoretically with forms of normativity, albeit on its own empirical terms rather than on legal theory’s analytical terms. The book then explores the third challenge, a result of the changing nature of society, by highlighting the move from the industrial relations of early modernity to the post-industrial conditions of late modernity, an age dominated by information technology. It poses the question whether socio-legal research has sufficiently reassessed its own theoretical premises regarding the relationship between law, state and society, so as to grasp the new social and cultural forms of organization specific to the twenty-first century’s global societies.

Some recent research also indicates that certain behavioural profiles may have a strong genetic basis, such as the determination to succeed and win or the propensity for risk-taking, which may be of interest to third parties. However, as this technology becomes more prevalent there is a danger that the genetic information may be misused by entities such as employers, insurance companies, educational facilities, and finance companies and that people with particular genetic profiles may be discriminated against.This book explores the different types and the potential uses of genetic testing. The book highlights the ethical and legal dilemmas and the challenges arising as a result of emerging and rapidly advancing genetic science. Chapters in the book assess the importance and impact of the US Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act (GINA) in the employment and health insurance contexts asking whether it is proving to be an effective tool in addressing the issue of genetic discrimination and alleviating individuals' fears of discrimination. The book then goes on to make the case for regulation at the European Union level in order to protect the privacy of genetic information and to prevent the discriminatory use of genetic information in Europe. It considers what can be learnt from the experience of the US in addressing ethical and legal issues as well as the impact that the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is having on this debate within the EU"-- Publisher's description: Taking its cue from Matthew 19:6, 'What, therefore, God hath joined together, let not man put asunder, ' this book describes humankind's actions in doing just that.

This new edition in the Swedish Studies in European Law series, the work of both legal scholars and politicians, aims to create a modern codification in the tradition of the great continental codifications such as the BGB and the Code Civil. A significant step towards this development was taken in 2009 with the creation of the Draft Common Frame of Reference which contains model rules for a large part of central private law. The process raises a number of questions. What are the advantages and disadvantages of such an intensive process of harmonisation? Are there lessons to be learnt from the Europeanisation of private law through history? Are there any further steps which have been taken in order to create a European private law? What is the future of European private law? These crucial questions were discussed at a conference in Stockholm, sponsored by the Swedish Network of European Legal Studies. This important volume includes the answers offered by leading scholars in the field.--","[*] 1033546702 [*] 893894006 [*] 819816676 [*] 1849466971 1-78471-331-7 [*] 140947481X (ebook PUB) [*] 868641826 [*] ^^2014025060 [*] ^^2012048044 [*] 9781849466974 [*] ^^2016048079","[*] mul [*] English [*] ger [*] eng [*] spa [*] ita","[*] 1 sound disc: digital; 4 3/4 in.

Asser Instituut in The Hague, the collection reflects the breadth and scope of the Institute’s research activities in the fields of public international law, EU law, private international law and international and European sports law. It does so by shedding more light on topical issues – such as drone warfare, the fight against terrorism, the international trade environment nexus and forced arbitration – that can be related to the theme of fundamental rights, which runs through all these four areas of research. Points of divergence and areas of common ground are uncovered in contributions from both staff members and distinguished external authors, having long-standing academic relations with the Institute. The Editors of this book are all staff members of the T.M.C. Asser Instituut, each of them representing one of the areas of research the Institute covers.

This Fifth Edition fully updates its systematic description of the legal sources, institutions, and concepts in all major fields of law. Recent developments covered include the progressive implementation of standards set by international conventions, the reorganization of the judiciary, the statute on environmental law, and the (re)codification of private international law. The continuing influence of European law is evident in many fields, perhaps most notably in family law. The various chapters are written by experts - scholars and lawyers - in particular fields, and provide an authoritative overview of each field. The historical sources of Dutch law are discussed, as well as Dutch legal culture, judicial organization, legal education, and the legal profession. These chapters are followed by introductions to essential issues of private and public law and labour law. The last chapter examines questions of legal philosophy. The only resource of its kind available, this book is unmatched as a thorough guide to further research. It offers practitioners, particularly foreign lawyers, a quick and reliable way into any area of Dutch law that they may be required to research. It will also be of great value to comparatists (especially those studying the influence of European law on national legal systems), scholars, and students. Like previous editions, the Fifth Edition has been prepared under the auspices of the Netherlands Comparative Law Association"--Unedited summary from book cover.

The contributions in this book extend beyond the treatment of legal issues and show how lawyers, economists, psychologists, and business scholars can help design antitrust law compliance programmes more effectively and run them more efficiently.

As a process of social change, globalization has been propelled by rapid technological innovation which rendered massive instantaneous communication possible as well as extensive processes of de-regulation and liberalization. The combined effect of these developments was the emergence of non-State actors which operate across national borders and master substantial economic and informational power. Meanwhile, the State, as the primary agency of governance, has remained jurisdictionally territorial while becoming less dominantly powerful. Both features have resulted in a 'governance crisis' and have turned globalization into a 'legal problematic'. In response, legal governance adopted six different modalities: de-globalization through regulation, extraterritoriality, legal harmonization, legal cooperation, privatization of law-making and law enforcement and supranational legal regimes. Each of these modalities presents a certain deviation from traditional legal principles. Resolving the tension between change and continuity is a two-way process which involves revising both the legal response to globalization and the traditional principles that it challenges." "Money laundering law offers a fertile case study of these new developments in the legal order. It is a case which demonstrates emphatically the legal problematic, the modalities of the solution and the challenges they pose. Other cases drawn from UN law, environmental law, securities regulation and internet law will also show that money laundering law is not an isolated incident."--BOOK JACKET.","[*] 948560687 [*] 0903067730 [*] 1033546702 [*] 56768919 [*] 819816676 1-78471-331-7 [*] 140947481X (ebook PUB) [*] 868641826 [*] ^^2004484695 [*] ^^2014025060 [*] ^^2012048044","[*] mul [*] English [*] ger [*] eng [*] spa [*] ita","xii, 249 p. ; 24 cm.

It seeks to analyse the contribution of law in constructing, maintaining and perpetuating anthropocentrism and addresses the ways in which this orientation can be undermined and ultimately eliminated. In place of anthropocentrism, Earth Jurisprudence advocates an interpretation of law based on the ecocentric concept of an Earth community that includes both human and nonhuman entities.

The book also reviews what may be learnt from GINA within employment and health insurance contexts, and asks how the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) may impact similar debates within the European Union. This book will be of great interest to scholars and students of discrimination law, bioethics, and disability law, and will be of considerable use to medical practitioners and policy makers in this area"-- [*] It then poses the question: Do international criminal tribunals distinguish, as defined by Schwarzenberger, between the 'law-creating processes' of public international law on the one hand, and the 'law-determining agencies' as a subsidiary means of determining rule of law on the other? Assuming that they exist, how can different methodological approaches to determine customary international law be assessed in light of the nullum crimen sine lege principle? Does the principle require judges to apply the traditional method to establish customary international law as being based on extensive, uniform and enduring State practice accompanied by opinio iuris? Can the principle balance the desire for justice and the specificities of law creation of the international legal order with fairness for the accused?

Some papers focus on international and regional developments in comparative context, while others deal with practical concerns around mediation, specialisation in child and family law services, and courts. The book also contains papers on contemporary law reform and related challenges, for instance in relation to Islamic marriages, the publication of divorce proceedings, the Children's Act 38 of 2005, and domestic partnerships. This book is an essential guide to contemporary debates in the child and family law arena in South African context and beyond, and will be a useful tool for researchers, policy makers and practitioners alike.","[*] ^^2013036613 [*] 1033546702 [*] 819816676 [*] 9780203798911 (ebk) 1-78471-331-7 [*] ^^2009382166 [*] 298543616 [*] 9780702179488 (pbk.)

In the same manner the first model form of Joint Operating Agreements (JOAs) was developed in 1956 by the American Association of Professional Landmen. This historical model form provided the industry with guidance for future generations of JOAs. Although the JOAs were initially used in common law jurisdictions (US, Canada, UK, etc.) later on it was used in civil law jurisdictions throughout South America, Africa, Europe and Asia. There is no JOA model available in the industry to address all of the requirements from a large variety of civil law perspectives. The Norwegian and Greenlandic authorities offer their own JOA models, which are suitable within these jurisdictions. The AIPN JOA model form 2012 issued a short guidance note for civil law issues. Although this initiative was very much welcomed by the industry, it was not possible to provide extensive guidance on every detail and provide advice on exactly what your JOA provisions should look like at the very end. Therefore, the main issue for the petroleum industry is the fact that large upstream investments could be done based on a contract that might not be enforceable in a civil law jurisdiction. This book analyses the main issues that a JOA might face within seventeen civil jurisdictions with large oil and gas reserves or at least large potential (including but not limited to Angola, Argentina, Brazil, China, France, Holland, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Mozambique, Norway, Russia, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, etc.).

The book highlights the ethical and legal dilemmas and the challenges arising as a result of emerging and rapidly advancing genetic science. Chapters in the book assess the importance and impact of the US Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act (GINA) in the employment and health insurance contexts asking whether it is proving to be an effective tool in addressing the issue of genetic discrimination and alleviating individuals' fears of discrimination. The book then goes on to make the case for regulation at the European Union level in order to protect the privacy of genetic information and to prevent the discriminatory use of genetic information in Europe. It considers what can be learnt from the experience of the US in addressing ethical and legal issues as well as the impact that the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is having on this debate within the EU"-- "This book addresses issues concerning the shifting contemporary meaning of legal certainty. The book focuses on exploring the emerging tensions that exist between the demand for legal certainty and the challenges of regulating complex, late modern societies. The book is divided into two parts: the [second] part focusing on debates around legal certainty at the national level, with a primary emphasis on criminal law; and the [first] part focusing on debates at the transnational level, with a primary emphasis on the regulation of transnational commercial transactions. In the context of legal modernity, the principle of legal certainty (the idea that the law must be sufficiently clear to provide those subject to legal norms with the means to regulate their own conduct and to protect against the arbitrary use of public power) has operated as a foundational rule of law value. Even though it has not always been fully realized, legal certainty has functioned as a core value and aspiration that has structured normative debates throughout political modernity, both at a national and international level. In recent decades, however, legal certainty has come under increasing pressure from a number of competing demands that are made of contemporary law, in particular the demand that the law be more flexible and responsive to a social environment characterized by rapid social and technological change. The expectation that the law operates in new transnational contexts and regulates every widening sphere of social life has created a new degree of uncertainty, and this change raises difficult questions regarding both the possibility and desirability of legal certainty. This book compiles, in one edited volume, research from a range of substantive areas of civil and criminal law that shares a common interest in understanding the multi-layered challenges of defining legal certainty in a late modern society"--Back cover. [*] ""Law," in this book, includes basic common law subjects (such as property, torts, and contracts), as well as statutory and constitutional issues, including issues associated with gender, race, and domestic relations. The domain of law also includes foundational issues of American political and social theory, such as sovereignty, liberty, equality, and criminal justice. It includes the evolving status and roles of members of the legal profession as influential figures in American culture. Understanding the importance of law in American society begins with recognition of the multiple dimensions of "legal" activity. Law, over the course of American history, has reflected the changing cultural settings in which legal decisions have been made, and has helped shape those settings. The Constitution of the United States was drafted in response to a set of political, economic, social, and intellectual concerns held by some late eighteenth-century Americans. Those concerns centered on the structural and functional efficacy of the form of federal government created by the Articles of Confederation in 1781, and were a product of a particular set of historical experiences. But once the Constitution was drafted and ratified, an authoritative legal document had recast the form and structure of American government, providing a framework into which future political, economic, social, and intellectual issues would be set. As the example suggests, law has not been only a cultural artifact in the history of American civilization, but also a causal agent in the unfolding of that history"-- [*] is unwritten in nature?"--Back cover.

To do so, it elaborates a theoretical model for achieving Rule-of-law and compares it to the constitutional review systems of the United States, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Mexico. The study concludes that the two former states correspond to the model, while the latter does not. This is fundamentally due to the role each legal system assigns to ordinary jurisdiction in carrying out constitutional review. Whereas the US and Germany have fostered the policy that constitutional review regarding the enforcement of basic rights is the responsibility of ordinary courts, Mexico has relied too heavily on the specialized constitutional jurisdiction.  .

The selected focus areas are grouped in sections, such as agrobiodiversity, fishing and aquaculture, pollinators and pesticides, soil management, industrial animal production and transportation, and international food trade. Farm animal welfare, environmental protection, biodiversity conservation, and food safety are the core of the selected chapters. Every chapter provides real-world examples to make the complex field easy to understand. With its systematic approach, this book is devoted to anyone interested in the subject, becomes a valuable resource for professionals working in food regulation, and provides a solid foundation for courses and master’s programs in animal law, environmental policy, food and agriculture law, and regulation of these subjects around the world. Through its emphasis on sustainable food production, this work offers a cutting-edge selection of evolving topics at the heart of the pertinent discourse. As one of its highlights, this books also provides “Tools for Change,” a unique compilation and analysis of laws from the major farm animal product trading nations. With these tools, practitioners, advocates, policy makers and other state-holders are equipped with information to start work toward improving farm animal welfare, wildlife conservation, and food safety through the use of law and policy.

The book takes a panoramic view of the foundation of various legal systems with a subsequent examination of different areas of legal liability that may affect business activities. These areas include contract law, agency, tort law, criminal law and internet law as significant challenges confronting the business sector. The book primarily targets the development of business law principles in several Caribbean Commonwealth jurisdictions but also, where appropriate, embraces the jurisprudence of other Commonwealth nations such as the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. With respect to internet law, the proliferation of judicial pronouncements emerging from the United States and their relevance to the Anglophone Caribbean provided the platform for the only non-Commonwealth treatment of a topic.

Backed by potent and haunting images, it argues that the rule of law is the one universal framework that everyone believes in and that the law is now the most important ideology we have for our survival. The author explores the decline of religions and the huge growth of law and makes predictions for the future of law and lawyers. The book maintains that even though societies may decide they can do without religions, they cannot do without law. The book helpfully summarises both the teachings of all the main religions and the central tenets of the law - governing everything from human relationships to money, banks and corporations. It shows that, without these legal constructs, some of them arcane, our societies would grind to a halt. These innovative summaries make complex ideas seem simple and provide the keys to understanding both the law and religion globally. The book will appeal to both lawyers and the general reader.0The book concludes with the author's personal code for a modern way of living to promote the survival of humankind into the future. Vividly written by one of the most important lawyers of our generation, this magisterial and exciting work offers a powerful vision of the role of law in centuries to come and its impact on how we stay alive.

The stakeholders’ equally weighty arguments that must be balanced against are, on the one hand, the property interest in an earned IP right in the design of the part; and on the other, enhanced competition, likely reflected in lower prices. The mounting tension between these two positions is manifest an increased number of lawsuits in both the US and the EU. This book provides a discussion of the legal issues involved in this debate from a global perspective, with special focus on the EU and the US. Part I contextualizes the legal debate by discussing the historical background, the competitive situation and the respective stakeholder positions. Part II examines the relevant legal questions on a comparative basis, evaluating the likelihood of its adoption in the jurisdictions examined. Concluding that adoption is unlikely, Part III proposes a number of possible considerations meant to further compromise. Part IV concludes with a future outlook, specifically in light of the impact of technological development on this market.

It explores how State recognition of religious rules can affect the degree of legal diversity that is available to citizens and why such recognition sometime results in more individual and collective freedom and sometime in a threat to equality of citizens before the law. The first part of the book contains a few contributions that place this discussion within the wider debate on legal pluralism. While State law and religious rules are two normative systems among many others, the specific characteristics of the latter are at the heart of tensions that emerge with increasing frequency in many countries. The second part is devoted to the analysis of about twenty national cases that provide an overview of the different tools and strategies that are employed to manage the relationship between State law and religious rules all over the world.","[*] 0-511-38011-9 [*] ^^2015007049 [*] 932463366 [*] 904144394 [*] 3319283332 [*] 9783319283333 1-78471-331-7 [*] 931644436 [*] 1315775875 (ebk) [*] 2007039899 [*] 9781315775876 (ebk)","[*] mul [*] English [*] ger [*] eng [*] spa [*] ita","[*] 72 videocassettes: sd., col. ; 1/2 in.

The book comprehensively addresses opportunities in space and the inevitable legal challenges that these space activities pose for mankind. It explores the increasing role of private sector in outer space, which calls for a review of policy and legislation; invites opinio juris from law scholars for ensuring the applicability of the Outer Space Treaty on all states without ratification and universal abidance with Space Law without demur; reflects upon the challenges for the global space community involved in implementing a more effective approach to international space governance; and considers the use of domestic laws, and the consequent need for legal reform, to encourage broader engagement with commercial space innovation. Further, the book delves into the adequacy of existing international liability regime to protect space tourists in the event of a space vehicle accidents; examines the increasing use of space for military activities and canvasses how International Law may apply to condition behaviour; highlights the challenges of scavenging space debris; calls for protections of space assets; touches upon the legal regime pertaining to ASAT and discusses other ways of creating normative instruments, which also come from other areas and use other methods. Given its comprehensive coverage of opportunities in space and the inevitable legal challenges that they pose, the book offers a valuable resource for students, researchers, academics and professionals including government officials, industry executives, specialists, and lawyers, helping them understand essential contemporary issues and developments in Space Law.","[*] 0-511-38011-9 [*] ^^2015007049 [*] 932463366 [*] 904144394 [*] 981-10-4926-2 1-78471-331-7 [*] 931644436 [*] 1315775875 (ebk) [*] 10.1007/978-981-10-4926-2 [*] 2007039899 [*] 9781315775876 (ebk)","[*] mul [*] English [*] ger [*] eng [*] spa [*] ita","[*] 72 videocassettes: sd., col. ; 1/2 in.

One of the main reasons for this is the importance of availability of credit and the consequent need to reform collateral laws in order to improve access to finance. The ability to give security effectively influences not only the cost of credit but also, in some cases, whether credit will be available at all. This requires rules that are transparent and readily accessible to non-lawyers as well as rules that recognise the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises. This book critically engages with the challenges posed by inefficient secured credit laws. It offers a comparative analysis of the reasons and the needs for a secured transactions law reform, as well as discussion of the steps taken in many common law, civil law and mixed law jurisdictions. The book, written under the auspices of the Secured Transactions Law Reform Project, informs the debate about reform and advances novel arguments written by world renowned experts that will build upon the existing literature, and as such will be of interest to academics, legal practitioners and the judiciary involved in secured transactions law around the world.

"The book explores the relationship between Muslims, the Common Law and Sharīʻah post-9/11. The book looks at the accommodation of Sharīʻah Law within Western Common Law legal traditions and the role of the judiciary, in particular, in drawing boundaries for secular democratic states with Muslim populations who want resolutions to conflicts that also comply with the dictates of their faith. Salim Farrar and Ghena Krayem consider the question of recognition of Sharīʻah by looking at how the flexibilities that exists in both the Common Law and Sharīʻah provide unexplored avenues for navigation and accommodation. The issue is explored in a comparative context across several jurisdictions and case law is examined in the contexts of family law, business and crime from selected jurisdictions with significant Muslim minority populations including: Australia, Canada, England and Wales, and the United States. The book examines how Muslims and the broader community have framed their claims for recognition against a backdrop of terrorism fears, and how Common Law judiciaries have responded within their constitutional and statutory confines and also within the contemporary contexts of demands for equality, neutrality and universal human rights. Acknowledging the inherent pragmatism, flexibility and values of the Common Law, the authors argue that the controversial issue of accommodation of Sharīʻah is not necessarily one that requires the establishment of a separate and parallel legal system." -- Back cover.

Indeed, the simultaneous processes of globalization combined with the disintegration of international systems of governance and law-making pose complex challenges for legal scholarship.

This book...[approaches] international law, viewing the processes of the fragmentation and constitutionalisation as being profoundly interconnected and reflective of each other. It brings together a select group of contributors...in order to explore the ways in which the problems of fragmentation and constitutionalisation are viscerally linked one to the other and thus mutually conditioning and stimulating.

Each story unfolds along boundaries―between men and women, slave and free, black and white, rich and poor, old and young―as rigid social orders are upset in ways that drive people into the courtroom. One case involves a settler in a rural county along the Colorado River, his thirty-year relationship with an enslaved woman, and the claims of their children as heirs. A case in East Texas arose after an owner refused to pay an overseer who had shot one of her slaves. Another case details how a free family of color carved out a life in the sparsely populated marshland of Southeast Texas, only to lose it all as waves of new settlers “civilized” the county. An enslaved woman in Galveston who was set free in her owner’s will―and who got an uncommon level of support from her attorneys―is the subject of another case. In a Central Texas community, as another case recounts, citizens forced a Choctaw native into court in an effort to gain freedom for his slave, a woman who easily “passed” as white. The cases considered here include Gaines v. Thomas, Clark v. Honey, Brady v. Price, and Webster v. Heard. All of them pitted communal attitudes and values against the exigencies of daily life in an often harsh place. Here are real people in their own words, as gathered from trial records, various legal documents, and many other sources. People of many colors, from diverse backgrounds, weave their way in and out of the narratives. We come to know what mattered most to them―and where those personal concerns stood before the law."--","[*] 9780820351322 [*] 0-511-38011-9 [*] 965446490 [*] 9780820351636 [*] 9780820351339 [*] 904144394 [*] 0820351334 1-78471-331-7 [*] ^^2016055423 [*] 2007039899 [*] 0820351636","[*] mul [*] English [*] ger [*] eng [*] spa [*] ita","[*] 72 videocassettes: sd., col. ; 1/2 in.

It offers in-depth analyses and discussions of topical and important issues in animal laws and animal welfare, and provides a comprehensive and comparative snapshot of some of the most important countries in the world in terms of animal population and worsening animal cruelty. Among the issues discussed are international law topics that relate to animals, including the latest WTO ruling on seal products and the EU ban, the Blackfish story and US law for cetaceans, the wildlife trafficking and crimes related to Africa and China, and historical and current animal protection laws in the UK and Australia. Bringing together the disciplines of animal law and animal welfare science as well as ethics and criminology with contributions from some of the most prominent animal welfare scientists and animal law scholars in the world, the book considers the strengths and failings of existing animal protection law in different parts of the world.

Principles of International Economic Law' provides a comprehensive overview of the central topics in international economic law, with an emphasis on the interplay between the different economic and political interests on both the international and domestic levels. Following recent tendencies, the book sets the classic topics of international economic law, like WTO law, investment protection, commercial law and monetary law in context with aspects of human rights, environmental protection and the legitimate claims of developing countries. The book draws a concise picture of the architecture of international economic law with all its complexities, without getting lost in fragmented details. Providing a perfect introductory text to the field of international economic law, the book thoroughly analyses legal developments within their wider political, economic, or social context. Topics covered range from codes of conduct for multinational enterprises, to the human rights implications of the exploitation of natural resources. The book demonstrates the economic foundations and economic implications of legal frameworks.00. [*] "International Environmental Law International Environmental Law offers a concise, conceptually clear, and legally rigorous introduction to contemporary international environmental law and practice. The book covers all major environmental agreements, paying particular attention to their underlying structure, main legal provisions, and practical operation. It blends legal and policy analysis, making extensive reference to the jurisprudence and scholarship, and addressing the interconnections with other areas of international law, including human rights, humanitarian law, trade and foreign investment. The material is structured into four sections - foundations, substantive regulation, implementation, and influence on other areas of international law - which help the reader to navigate the different areas of international environmental law. Each chapter includes charts summarising the main components of the relevant legal frameworks and provides a detailed bibliography. Suitable for practicing and academic international lawyers who want an accessible, up-to-date introduction to contemporary international environmental law, as well as non-lawyers seeking a concise and clear understanding of the subject"-- [*] "International Environmental Law offers a concise, conceptually clear, and legally rigorous introduction to contemporary international environmental law and practice.

This perspective, which all the contributors bear in mind when treating their own topic, also constitutes a useful element in the effort to bring today's legal complexity and fragmentation to a homogenous vision of the sustainable use of the marine environment and of its resources, and also of the international and national response to maritime crimes. The volume analyzes the relevant legal frameworks and recent developments, focusing on the competing interests which have influenced State jurisdiction and other regulatory processes. An analysis of the competing interests and their developments allows us to identify actors and relevant legal and institutional contexts, retracing how and when these elements have changed over time."-- [*] It then poses the question: Do international criminal tribunals distinguish, as defined by Schwarzenberger, between the 'law-creating processes' of public international law on the one hand, and the 'law-determining agencies' as a subsidiary means of determining rule of law on the other?

The domain of law also includes foundational issues of American political and social theory, such as sovereignty, liberty, equality, and criminal justice. It includes the evolving status and roles of members of the legal profession as influential figures in American culture. Understanding the importance of law in American society begins with recognition of the multiple dimensions of "legal" activity. Law, over the course of American history, has reflected the changing cultural settings in which legal decisions have been made, and has helped shape those settings. The Constitution of the United States was drafted in response to a set of political, economic, social, and intellectual concerns held by some late eighteenth-century Americans. Those concerns centered on the structural and functional efficacy of the form of federal government created by the Articles of Confederation in 1781, and were a product of a particular set of historical experiences. But once the Constitution was drafted and ratified, an authoritative legal document had recast the form and structure of American government, providing a framework into which future political, economic, social, and intellectual issues would be set. As the example suggests, law has not been only a cultural artifact in the history of American civilization, but also a causal agent in the unfolding of that history"-- This collection provides an intellectually rigorous and accessible overview of key topics in contemporary natural law jurisprudence, an influential yet frequently misunderstood branch of legal philosophy. It fills a gap in the existing literature by bringing together leading international experts on natural law theory to provide perspectives on some of the most pressing issues pertaining to the nature and moral foundations of law. Themes covered include the history of the natural law tradition, the natural law account of practical reason, normativity and ethics, natural law approaches to legal obligation and authority and constitutional law. Creating a dialogue between leading figures in natural law thought, the Companion is an ideal introduction to the main commitments of natural law jurisprudence, whilst also offering a concise summary of developments in current scholarship for more advanced readers. [*] It then poses the question: Do international criminal tribunals distinguish, as defined by Schwarzenberger, between the 'law-creating processes' of public international law on the one hand, and the 'law-determining agencies' as a subsidiary means of determining rule of law on the other? Assuming that they exist, how can different methodological approaches to determine customary international law be assessed in light of the nullum crimen sine lege principle? Does the principle require judges to apply the traditional method to establish customary international law as being based on extensive, uniform and enduring State practice accompanied by opinio iuris? Can the principle balance the desire for justice and the specificities of law creation of the international legal order with fairness for the accused? How can the law be accessible and criminal punishment foreseeable, when the underlying legal basis for criminal convictions, namely customary international criminal law,^","[*] 0-511-38011-9 [*] 965446490 [*] 9781107546462 [*] 9781107120518 [*] 904144394 [*] 1107120519 [*] ^^2016053732 1-78471-331-7 [*] 963359588 [*] 2007039899 [*] 110754646X","[*] mul [*] English [*] ger [*] eng [*] spa [*] ita","[*] 72 videocassettes: sd., col. ; 1/2 in.

It is one of the first publications addressing all the changes in the Brussels I regulatory scheme, which takes into consideration relevant CJEU case law up to July 2016. The texts, written by legal scholars who have published extensively in the field of private international law and international civil procedure, will add to the development of EU private international law. In addition, the authors’ critical analysis may open further discussions on the topic and so benefit a consistent and harmonised application of the Regulation. In this respect the book takes a different approach than the commentaries which have so far been published.

It offers a forum for the publication of scholarly articles of a more general nature in the area of public international law including the law of the european Union.   One of the key functions or purposes of international law (and law in general for that matter) is to provide long-term stability and legal certainty. Yet, international legal rules may also function as tools to deal with non-permanent or constantly changing issues, and rather than stable, international law may have to be flexible or adaptive. Prima facie, one could think of two main types of temporary aspects relevant from the perspective of international law. First, the nature of the object addressed by international law or the ‘problem’ that international law aims to address may be inherently temporary (temporary objects). Second, a subject of international law may be created for a specific period of time, after the elapse of which this entity ceases to exist (temporary subjects). These types of temporariness raise several questions from the perspective of international law, which are hardly addressed from a more conceptual perspective. This volume of the Netherlands Yearbook of International Law aims to do exactly that by asking the question of how international law reacts to various types of temporary issues. Put differently, where does international law stand on the continuum of predictability and pragmatism when it comes to temporary issues or institutions? [*] It then poses the question: Do international criminal tribunals distinguish, as defined by Schwarzenberger, between the 'law-creating processes' of public international law on the one hand, and the 'law-determining agencies' as a subsidiary means of determining rule of law on the other?

A number of states have recently either codified Muslim family law, or have issued significant amendments or new laws on the subject. This study considers these new laws along with older statutes to comment on patterns and dynamics of change both in the texts of the laws and in the processes by which they are drafted and issued. It draws on original legal texts as well as on secondary literature for an insight into practice; interventions by women's rights organizations and other parties are drawn on to identify areas of the laws that remain contested. The discussions are set in the contemporary global context that internationalises the domestic and regional discussions."--book jacket.","[*] 0-511-38011-9 [*] 965446490 [*] 144661757 [*] 904144394 80959191 [*] 9789053569740 [*] 905356974X [*] 9093740 [*] 10.1007/978-94-6265-060-2 [*] 2007039899 [*] Harvard Law School Record Corp., 1585 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge MA 02138","[*] mul [*] English [*] ger [*] eng [*] spa [*] ita","[*] 1 sound disc: digital; 4 3/4 in.

The broad premise of [this book] is that the 'artificial reason' of law was a complex art form that shared the same rhetorical strategy as the plays of Shakespeare. Common law and Shakespearean drama of this period employed various aesthetic devices to capture the imagination and the emotional attachment of their respective audiences. Common law of the Jacobean era, as spoken in the law courts, learnt at the Inns of Court and recorded in the law reports, used imagery that would have been familiar to audiences of Shakespeare's plays. In its juridical form, English law was intrinsically dramatic, its adversarial mode of expression being founded on an agonistic model. Conversely, Shakespeare borrowed from the common law some of its most critical themes: justice, legitimacy, sovereignty, community, fairness, and (above all else) humanity. Each chapter investigates a particular aspect of the common law, seen through the lens of a specific play by Shakespeare. Topics include the unprecedented significance of rhetorical skills to the practice and learning of common law (Love's Labour's Lost); the early modern treason trial as exemplar of the theatre of law (Macbeth); the art of law as the legitimate distillation of the law of nature (The Winter's Tale); the efforts of common lawyers to create an image of nationhood from both classical and Judeo-Christian mythography (Cymbeline); and the theatrical device of the island as microcosm of the Jacobean state and the project of imperial expansion (The Tempest)." -- Page i.","[*] 0-511-38011-9 [*] 956960164 [*] 9781509905478 [*] 904144394 80959191 [*] 9781509905485 [*] ^^2016037920 [*] 9781509905492 [*] 2007039899 [*] 1509905480 [*] 1509905472","[*] mul [*] English [*] ger [*] eng [*] spa [*] ita","[*] 1 sound disc: digital; 4 3/4 in.

The domain of law also includes foundational issues of American political and social theory, such as sovereignty, liberty, equality, and criminal justice. It includes the evolving status and roles of members of the legal profession as influential figures in American culture. Understanding the importance of law in American society begins with recognition of the multiple dimensions of "legal" activity. Law, over the course of American history, has reflected the changing cultural settings in which legal decisions have been made, and has helped shape those settings. The Constitution of the United States was drafted in response to a set of political, economic, social, and intellectual concerns held by some late eighteenth-century Americans. Those concerns centered on the structural and functional efficacy of the form of federal government created by the Articles of Confederation in 1781, and were a product of a particular set of historical experiences. But once the Constitution was drafted and ratified, an authoritative legal document had recast the form and structure of American government, providing a framework into which future political, economic, social, and intellectual issues would be set. As the example suggests, law has not been only a cultural artifact in the history of American civilization, but also a causal agent in the unfolding of that history"-- The law of outer space is rapidly evolving to adapt to changes in the economic drivers as well as advancements in technological capabilities. The contents of this book are a reflection of this changing environment as evidenced in the writings of the second and third generations of space lawyers. Theoretical aspects of space law are explored by chapters relating to fundamental concepts central to the corpus juris spatialis. Practical aspects of space law are probed by examinations into international and domestic regulation of commercial activities, with particular emphasis on African, Asian, and European perspectives. International policy considerations are scrutinized in relation to military uses of outer space.^ The scientific Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) is the subject of a concise history of the discipline vis-a-vis the role of the SETI Permanent Committee of the International Academy of Astronautics (IAA), and also of a study of the policy and other ramifications of social media in the event of the discovery of intelligent extraterrestrial beings. The book concludes with the republication of the seminal and highly influential Relations With Alien Intelligences The Scientific Basis of Metalaw by Dr. Ernst Fasan, first published in 1970. Scholar, author, and attorney Ernst Fasan was among the original space lawyers, a small, pioneering group of visionaries who recognized that the movement of man into space must be accomplished without the shackles of history and in an environment free from the threat of the use of space as an instrument of armed aggression. The influence of Dr.^ Fasan has extended beyond the international legal community to the broader scientific community, especially to the field of astrobiology, as he pursued groundbreaking investigations into what could be the ultimate in legal relationships - metalaw - the interaction of sentient beings from different planets. The contributors to this Liber Amicorum are among those who can trace their own work to the foundations of space law placed in part by Ernst Fasan.","[*] 0-511-38011-9 [*] 956960164 [*] 904144394 80959191 [*] 9781509905485 [*] ^^2016037920 [*] 9783319270876 (ebk.)

Embedding these different perspectives in public international law, this book brings several key points of clarification to the legal framework. Firstly, the book draws upon social science literature on armed conflict to present a new viewpoint on the role that human rights law plays vis-a-vis international humanitarian law in non-international armed conflicts. Secondly, the book sheds light on the circumstances in which armed groups acquire obligations under human rights law. It brings illumination to these topics by combining historical and comparative research on belligerency, insurgency, and international humanitarian law with a theoretical analysis of legal personality under international law. In the final part of the book, the author tests the four most utilised theories of how armed groups are bound by human rights law, examining whether armed groups can be bound by virtue of (i) treaty law (ii) control of territory (iii) international criminal law and (iv) customary international law. In the book's conclusions, the author presents final remarks that are designed to provide concrete guidance on how the issue of armed groups and human rights law can be dealt with more thoroughly in practice" -- Prints and photographs collected by Harvard Law School professor Paul Freund.

The Research Handbook on EU Labour Law draws together contributions from leading academics in this field at an important historic moment in its development. As well as assessing the 'state of the art', they identify key research questions for the future. Split into four distinct parts, this Research Handbook provides a comprehensive examination of the major topics in EU labour, employment and equality law. Part One addresses cross-cutting themes, such as the relationship between EU law and national law, the role of human rights in EU labour law and the impact of austerity measures.

[*] The book examines the approaches to equity in international law; the climate change regime; theories of distributive justice; and various international regimes that aim at achieving equity in the distribution of a resource or benefit. Based on these investigations, this book provides a definition of equitable distribution under the CDM and identifies the key barriers to equitable distribution of projects and makes recommendations on how to overcome these barriers. This book will be the authority on distributive justice under the CDM, as there is no other book on this topic and no article that deals thoroughly with the issue. "-- [*] Of this number, four countries (China, India, Brazil and Mexico) account for about 75% of the projects in the CDM pipeline and most of the 69 host countries host just 1 or 2 projects. Understandably, this is a problem that countries are very keen to address, and since 2001, even before the first project was registered, countries have been highlighting the need to ensure that projects are equitably distributed among participating countries. This book looks at distributive justice under the CDM regime and focuses on the issue of equity in the geographic distribution of CDM projects among developing countries. The book investigates relevant aspects of theory and international law with the aim of identifying the legal characteristics of equitable distribution or distributive justice, in order to establish what equitable distribution in the CDM should look like.

But once the Constitution was drafted and ratified, an authoritative legal document had recast the form and structure of American government, providing a framework into which future political, economic, social, and intellectual issues would be set. As the example suggests, law has not been only a cultural artifact in the history of American civilization, but also a causal agent in the unfolding of that history"-- 'Comic Art, Creativity and the Law is a highly welcome addition to the literature on the development of comic art. The book stands out in its knowledge of the comic industry and analysis of the legal challenges confronting creative artists. You will enjoy reading it whether you are an art law specialist or a Spiderman fan.'--Peter K. Yu, Drake University Law School, US. 'In comics, justice always prevails, but the business of comics is a lot trickier. Marc Greenberg combines the expertise of a legal scholar with the passion and insight of a long-time comics fan, untangling the morass of legal issues facing comics--and all creative enterprises--^ in the past, present and future. Comic Art, Creativity and the Law is essential reading for anyone interested in understanding the multi-billion dollar global industry that comics has spawned.'--Rob Salkowitz, author of Comic-Con and the Business of Pop Culture. 'Marc Greenberg's Comic Art, Creativity and the Law gives a detailed, thoughtful "look under the hood" of one of the United States' most vibrant and under appreciated creative industries. For anyone who cares about truly understanding the creative process and the lives of authors in our times, this should be part of your library.'--Justin Hughs, William H. Hannon Professor of Law, Loyola Law School and chief US negotiator for the Beijing and Marrakesh copyright treaties. 'An intellectual tour de force and a compelling read . . .^ Far beyond a practical guide to the law of comics (though it is that too), Greenberg's book touches on the nature of creativity, the basis for IP law and the history of this fascinating medium.'--Professor Mark A. Lemley, Director, Stanford Law School, US. The characters and stories found in comic art play a dominant role in contemporary popular culture throughout the world. In this first-of-its-kind work, Comic Art, Creativity and the Law examines how law and legal doctrine shapes the creative process as applied to comic art. The book examines the impact of contract law, copyright law (including termination rights, parody and ownership of characters), tax law and obscenity law has on the creative process. It considers how these laws enhance and constrain the process of creating comic art by examining the effect their often inconsistent and incoherent application has had on the lives of creators, retailers and readers of comic art.^ It uniquely explains the disparate results in two key comic book parody cases, the Winter Brothers case and the Air Pirates case, offering an explanation for the seemingly inconsistent results in those cases. Finally, it offers a detailed discussion and analysis of the history and operation of the 'work for hire' doctrine in copyright law and its effect on comic art creators. Designed for academics, practitioners, students and fans of comic art, the book offers proposals for changes in those laws that constrain the creative process, as well as a glimpse into the future of comic art and the law.

The CDM has been constantly evolving in order to ensure that it fulfils its objectives of mitigating climate change and contributing to sustainable development in developing countries.

Subjects include Freund, his family and associates, and Harvard Law School activities. The field of socio-legal research has encountered three fundamental challenges over the last three decades – it has been criticized for paying insufficient attention to legal doctrine, for failing to develop a sound theoretical foundation and for not keeping pace with the effects of the increasing globalization and internationalization of law, state and society. This book examines these three challenges from a methodological standpoint. It addresses the first two by demonstrating that legal sociology has much to say about justice as a kind of social experience and has always engaged theoretically with forms of normativity, albeit on its own empirical terms rather than on legal theory’s analytical terms. The book then explores the third challenge, a result of the changing nature of society, by highlighting the move from the industrial relations of early modernity to the post-industrial conditions of late modernity, an age dominated by information technology. It poses the question whether socio-legal research has sufficiently reassessed its own theoretical premises regarding the relationship between law, state and society, so as to grasp the new social and cultural forms of organization specific to the twenty-first century’s global societies.

Using concrete examples, the book does not assume any prior knowledge of copyright law, but brings together leading intellectual property researchers to consider the significant role of copyright law in shaping the needs of the modern digital world. It provides an insight into two distinct arenas: copyright and digital media. The exponential increase in the ability to multiply and disseminate information by digital means has sparked numerous conflicts pertaining to copyright – and in turn has prompted lawmakers to expand the scope of copyright protection in the digital age. Bearing in mind the new questions that the advent of the digital age has raised on the role and function of copyright, the book presents a collection of papers largely covering new frontiers and changing horizons especially in this area. The contributions intensively address core issues including the exhaustion principle, copyright and digital media, liability of hosting service providers, the originality requirement, accessibility to published works for the visually disabled, criminalization of copyright infringement, and software protection under copyright law, among others. Consisting of 14 papers, this book will be equally interesting to researchers, policymakers, practitioners and lawmakers, especially those active in the field of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).

[*] The book examines the approaches to equity in international law; the climate change regime; theories of distributive justice; and various international regimes that aim at achieving equity in the distribution of a resource or benefit. Based on these investigations, this book provides a definition of equitable distribution under the CDM and identifies the key barriers to equitable distribution of projects and makes recommendations on how to overcome these barriers. This book will be the authority on distributive justice under the CDM, as there is no other book on this topic and no article that deals thoroughly with the issue. "-- [*] Of this number, four countries (China, India, Brazil and Mexico) account for about 75% of the projects in the CDM pipeline and most of the 69 host countries host just 1 or 2 projects. Understandably, this is a problem that countries are very keen to address, and since 2001, even before the first project was registered, countries have been highlighting the need to ensure that projects are equitably distributed among participating countries. This book looks at distributive justice under the CDM regime and focuses on the issue of equity in the geographic distribution of CDM projects among developing countries. The book investigates relevant aspects of theory and international law with the aim of identifying the legal characteristics of equitable distribution or distributive justice, in order to establish what equitable distribution in the CDM should look like. This compact, highly engaging book examines the international legal regulation of both the conduct of States among themselves and conduct towards individuals, in relation to the use of cyberspace. Chapters introduce the perspectives of various stakeholders and the challenges for international law. The author discusses State responsibility and key cyberspace rights issues, and takes a detailed look at cyber warfare, espionage, crime and terrorism. The work also covers the situation of non-State actors and quasi-State actors (such as IS, or ISIS, or ISIL) and concludes with a consideration of future prospects for the international law of cyberspace. Readers may explore international rules in the areas of jurisdiction of States in cyberspace, responsibility of States for cyber activities, human rights in the cyber world, permissible responses to cyber attacks, and more. Other topics addressed include the rules of engagement in cyber warfare, suppression of cyber crimes, permissible limits of cyber espionage, and suppression of cyber-related terrorism. Chapters feature explanations of case law from various jurisdictions, against the background of real-life cyber-related incidents across the globe. Written by an internationally recognized practitioner in the field, the book objectively guides readers through on-going debates on cyber-related issues against the background of international law. This book is very accessibly written and is an enlightening read. It will appeal to a wide audience, from international lawyers to students of international law, military strategists, law enforcement officers, policy makers and the lay person. .

The domain of law also includes foundational issues of American political and social theory, such as sovereignty, liberty, equality, and criminal justice. It includes the evolving status and roles of members of the legal profession as influential figures in American culture.

The book investigates relevant aspects of theory and international law with the aim of identifying the legal characteristics of equitable distribution or distributive justice, in order to establish what equitable distribution in the CDM should look like. The high civilian death toll in protracted conflicts such as those in Syria or Iraq appears to demonstrate how little the international legal order has to offer to civilians at risk. A recent conference of states convened by the International Committee of the Red Cross referred to `an institutional vacuum in the area of international humanitarian law implementation'. Yet both international humanitarian law and the law of human rights establish a series of rights that, at least in theory, are intended to protect civilians. But which law or laws apply in a given situation and what are the obstacles to their implementation? How can the law assist civilians injured by new methods of warfare, such as drone strikes, or targeted by new forms of military organisation, such as transnational armed groups? Can the implementation gap be filled by the growing but sometimes controversial use of human rights courts to remedy violations of the laws of armed conflict, or by proposals for new instruments or mechanisms of civilian legal protection? This volume brings together contributions from leading academic authorities and legal practitioners to shed light on the situation of civilians in the grey zone between human rights and the laws of war. In Part 1 each chapter considers a key contested or boundary issue in defining the rights of civilians or non-combatants in today's conflicts. Part 2 goes on to assess current and developing legal mechanisms for addressing violations. As military intervention to protect civilians remains highly controversial, this volume looks at the alternative potential for developing a practice of civilian rights protection.

[*] ""Law," in this book, includes basic common law subjects (such as property, torts, and contracts), as well as statutory and constitutional issues, including issues associated with gender, race, and domestic relations. The domain of law also includes foundational issues of American political and social theory, such as sovereignty, liberty, equality, and criminal justice. It includes the evolving status and roles of members of the legal profession as influential figures in American culture. Understanding the importance of law in American society begins with recognition of the multiple dimensions of "legal" activity. Law, over the course of American history, has reflected the changing cultural settings in which legal decisions have been made, and has helped shape those settings. The Constitution of the United States was drafted in response to a set of political, economic, social, and intellectual concerns held by some late eighteenth-century Americans. Those concerns centered on the structural and functional efficacy of the form of federal government created by the Articles of Confederation in 1781, and were a product of a particular set of historical experiences. But once the Constitution was drafted and ratified, an authoritative legal document had recast the form and structure of American government, providing a framework into which future political, economic, social, and intellectual issues would be set. As the example suggests, law has not been only a cultural artifact in the history of American civilization, but also a causal agent in the unfolding of that history"-- [*] "The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is one of the "flexibility mechanisms" defined in the Kyoto Protocol and is an essential part of the current climate change regime.

The book starts with a general analysis of the issue, offering general conclusions about the experiences in different countries. It then analyses the aforementioned themes from the perspective of the domestic law of different European nations and a number of international organisations (European Union, MERCOSUR, and Andean Community). In addition, the book studies the role of the European Union in the progress towards the recognition and execution of foreign administrative acts, where the principle of mutual recognition plays a vital part.

It provides an historic understanding of how and why after 5,000 years of water governance, that governance still has not reached stability. It identifies the key research questions for water law and policy while providing an overview of the current global water governance regime, its evolving characteristics, and the legal theories involved in these changes. It focuses on water law and discusses the characteristics of national, supranational, and international water law through a combination of case studies and thematic chapters. The Evolution of the Law and Politics of Water is the first volume to take a global perspective on the evolution of water law and policy. It describes global patterns and sets forth the particulars of eight national legal systems drawn from every continent and five regional or supranational systems, as well as the body of customary international law as a whole. In particular, it is the first book to explore the interrelation between culture, religion, government and law in water governance and management. The volume is, therefore, a must-read for anyone interested in how water governance has changed through time and in different places as well as anyone interested in how water law has sought to channel water governance through time and in different places and what variables account for the relative success (or lack of success) of water law in performing this channelling function. It is suggestive of possible lines of water law reform and whether a particular reform is likely to be successful.

It attempts to sketch the main trends in legal modernisation in China, offering an outline of the principal features of contemporary Chinese law and a clearer understanding of its nature from a developmental perspective. It provides comprehensive coverage of topics: 'legal culture' and modern law reform, constitutional law, legal institutions, law-making, administrative law, criminal law, criminal procedure law, civil law, property, family law, contracts, torts, law on business entities, securities, bankruptcy, intellectual property, law on foreign investment and trade, Chinese investment overseas, dispute settlement and implementation of law. Fully revised, updated and considerably expanded, this edition of 'Chinese law : context and transformation' is a valuable and important resource for researchers, policy-makers and teachers alike. [*] "The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is one of the "flexibility mechanisms" defined in the Kyoto Protocol and is an essential part of the current climate change regime. The CDM has been constantly evolving in order to ensure that it fulfils its objectives of mitigating climate change and contributing to sustainable development in developing countries. The first CDM project was registered in 2004 and there are now about 3,500 registered projects, expected to reduce over 500 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually and over 2 billion tonnes by the end of 2012. Nevertheless, the CDM is still not perfect, and one of its main problems is the inequitable geographic distribution of projects among developing countries. Although there are currently 123 developing countries that are eligible to participate in the CDM, only 69 countries do so.

By the same token, it fosters the dialogue between European and American Law and Economics scholars. The traditional neo-classical microeconomic theory explains human behaviour by using Rational Choice. According to this model, people tend to maximize the difference between expected utility and cost (“expected utility theory”). This theory includes three assumptions: (1) unbounded rationality, (2) unbounded self-interest, and (3) unbounded willpower. Behavioural Economics questions these assumptions and endeavours to render economic analysis more realistic by underpinning it with psychological insights. In recent years, the influence of Behavioural Economics on the Economic Analysis of Law has gained momentum. Behavioural Law and Economics generates a better theoretical understanding of legal phenomena and offers a multitude of applications in legislation and legal adjudication. This volume is testament to the growing and thriving Law and Economics movement in Europe. The European Law and Economics community has steadily grown and the yearly Law and Economics Conference at the law faculty of the University of Lucerne has successfully become a guiding star in the vast sky of Law and Economics.

The domain of law also includes foundational issues of American political and social theory, such as sovereignty, liberty, equality, and criminal justice. It includes the evolving status and roles of members of the legal profession as influential figures in American culture. Understanding the importance of law in American society begins with recognition of the multiple dimensions of "legal" activity. Law, over the course of American history, has reflected the changing cultural settings in which legal decisions have been made, and has helped shape those settings.

Given the drastic changes in the two jurisdictions in recent decades, the book covers not only the current law, but also how these laws evolved into their current forms. Moreover, this book not restates black-letter laws, but also offers economic analysis of the driving force behind the legal evolution and examines whether the legal changes are economically efficient. Given China's dazzling economic development in the past three decades, few would question the importance of studying China, particularly the four basic legal fields that will shape the future of the Chinese regime and greatly affect the interest of foreign investors. Why Taiwan? To put China's legal changes in context, one has to find a proper benchmark. Hong Kong and Singapore are ruled by Chinese people, but their laws are fundamentally shaped by English common law, and they are both much smaller than Taiwan. Macao is in a similar situation, except that it has imported Portuguese law, which has hardly any influence on laws in China. By contrast, in the property, contract, and tort laws of China and Taiwan, the doctrinal structures are both civil-law, whereas in business organization law, the U.S. law is the main inspiration. Moreover, in many ways, private laws in China and Taiwan are heavily influenced by German jurisprudence, making the comparison even more meaningful. There is also strong evidence that Chinese scholars and legislature, in formulating these four areas of laws, widely consult laws and legal scholarship in Taiwan"-- [*] "The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) defined in the Kyoto Protocol is an essential part of the current climate change regime.

Building upon previous analyses which have focused on a single aspect of extraterritorially, this book examines the fields of Criminal and Human Rights law as the two main areas of non-private law which are frequently applied across borders. Both fields are placed in context before being drawn together in a coherent and systematic way. The book examines recent law and practice, as well as historic developments and explores the concept of enforcement. The author's analysis includes coverage of topics such as the criminalisation of sex-tourism, the extradition of white-collar criminals and the application of human rights law to Iraq following American and British intervention in the region. Law Across Borders goes on to point the way forward in the development of the extraterritorial application of public law, and suggests ways in which greater coherence can be achieved.

[*] The book examines the approaches to equity in international law; the climate change regime; theories of distributive justice; and various international regimes that aim at achieving equity in the distribution of a resource or benefit. Based on these investigations, this book provides a definition of equitable distribution under the CDM and identifies the key barriers to equitable distribution of projects and makes recommendations on how to overcome these barriers. This book will be the authority on distributive justice under the CDM, as there is no other book on this topic and no article that deals thoroughly with the issue. "-- [*] ""Law," in this book, includes basic common law subjects (such as property, torts, and contracts), as well as statutory and constitutional issues, including issues associated with gender, race, and domestic relations. The domain of law also includes foundational issues of American political and social theory, such as sovereignty, liberty, equality, and criminal justice. It includes the evolving status and roles of members of the legal profession as influential figures in American culture. Understanding the importance of law in American society begins with recognition of the multiple dimensions of "legal" activity. Law, over the course of American history, has reflected the changing cultural settings in which legal decisions have been made, and has helped shape those settings. The Constitution of the United States was drafted in response to a set of political, economic, social, and intellectual concerns held by some late eighteenth-century Americans. Those concerns centered on the structural and functional efficacy of the form of federal government created by the Articles of Confederation in 1781, and were a product of a particular set of historical experiences. But once the Constitution was drafted and ratified, an authoritative legal document had recast the form and structure of American government, providing a framework into which future political, economic, social, and intellectual issues would be set. As the example suggests, law has not been only a cultural artifact in the history of American civilization, but also a causal agent in the unfolding of that history"-- In the internet age, the need for effective consumer law enforcement has arguably never been greater. This timely book is a comparative law and economic analysis of the changing landscape of EU consumer law enforcement policy. EU member states are moving away from purely public or private law enforcement and now appear to be moving towards a more mixed approach, not least due to European legislation. This book reflects on the need for and creation of efficient enforcement designs. It examines the various economic factors according to which the efficiency of different enforcement mechanisms can be assessed. Hypothetical case scenarios within package travel and misleading advertising, dealing with substantial individual harm and trifling and widespread harm are used to illustrate various consumer law problems. Design suggestions on how to optimally mix enforcement mechanisms for these case scenarios are developed. The findings are then used as a benchmark to assess real life situations in countries with different enforcement traditions - the Netherlands, Sweden and England.-- [*] "The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) defined in the Kyoto Protocol is an essential part of the current climate change regime. The CDM has been constantly evolving in order to ensure that it fulfils its objectives of mitigating climate change and contributing to sustainable development in developing countries. Nevertheless, the CDM is still not perfect, and one of its main problems is the inequitable geographic distribution of projects among developing countries. Understandably, this is a problem that countries are very keen to address, and since 2001, even before the first project was registered, countries have been highlighting the need to ensure that projects are equitably distributed among participating countries. This book looks at distributive justice under the CDM regime and focuses on the issue of equity in the geographic distribution of CDM projects among developing countries. The book investigates relevant aspects of theory and international law with the aim of identifying the legal characteristics of equitable distribution or distributive justice in order to establish what equitable distribution in the CDM should look like. The book examines the approaches to equity in international law; the climate change regime; theories of distributive justice; and various international regimes that aim to achieve equity in the distribution of a resource or benefit. Based on these investigations, Tomilola Akanle breaks new ground in defining equitable distribution under the CDM and by exploring how key obstructions to the equitable distribution of projects may be overcome. The book will be of particular interest to academics and policymakers of climate change and the CDM within international law"-- [*] "This book examines the extraterritorial application of UK public law.

[*] ""Law," in this book, includes basic common law subjects (such as property, torts, and contracts), as well as statutory and constitutional issues, including issues associated with gender, race, and domestic relations. The domain of law also includes foundational issues of American political and social theory, such as sovereignty, liberty, equality, and criminal justice. It includes the evolving status and roles of members of the legal profession as influential figures in American culture. Understanding the importance of law in American society begins with recognition of the multiple dimensions of "legal" activity. Law, over the course of American history, has reflected the changing cultural settings in which legal decisions have been made, and has helped shape those settings. The Constitution of the United States was drafted in response to a set of political, economic, social, and intellectual concerns held by some late eighteenth-century Americans. Those concerns centered on the structural and functional efficacy of the form of federal government created by the Articles of Confederation in 1781, and were a product of a particular set of historical experiences. But once the Constitution was drafted and ratified, an authoritative legal document had recast the form and structure of American government, providing a framework into which future political, economic, social, and intellectual issues would be set. As the example suggests, law has not been only a cultural artifact in the history of American civilization, but also a causal agent in the unfolding of that history"-- [*] "The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) defined in the Kyoto Protocol is an essential part of the current climate change regime.

By providing a systematic analysis of the quantity and quality of international legal instruments referred to in the text of resolutions, the book reconstructs patterns of the Security Council’s behavioural regularities and assesses them against the provisions of the United Nations Charter, which establishes its mandate. The analysis is divided into three periods – the origins and Cold War period, post-Cold War period and the twenty-first century – and assesses the resolutions passed in each period by thematic category. The book argues that while international law plays an important role in shaping the politics of the Security Council, the Council’s resolutions do not contribute significantly to the development of international law.

Leading scholars from both sides of the Atlantic provide works of original scholarship focusing on current debates and trends from the two dominant common law systems. The chapters approach the subject areas from a variety of perspectives - doctrinal analysis, law and economic analysis, and social-legal studies, as well as other theoretical perspectives. The book covers the major themes that underlie the key debates relating to commercial contract law: role of consent; normative theories of contract law; contract design and good faith; implied terms and interpretation; policing contract behavior; misrepresentation, breach, and remedies; and the regional and international harmonization of contract law. Contributors provide insights on the many commonalities, but more interestingly, on the key divergences of the United States and United Kingdom's approaches to numerous areas of contract law. Such a comparative analysis provides a basis for future developments and improvements of commercial contract law in both countries, as well as other countries that are members of the common law systems.

Understanding the importance of law in American society begins with recognition of the multiple dimensions of "legal" activity. Law, over the course of American history, has reflected the changing cultural settings in which legal decisions have been made, and has helped shape those settings. The Constitution of the United States was drafted in response to a set of political, economic, social, and intellectual concerns held by some late eighteenth-century Americans. Those concerns centered on the structural and functional efficacy of the form of federal government created by the Articles of Confederation in 1781, and were a product of a particular set of historical experiences. But once the Constitution was drafted and ratified, an authoritative legal document had recast the form and structure of American government, providing a framework into which future political, economic, social, and intellectual issues would be set. As the example suggests, law has not been only a cultural artifact in the history of American civilization, but also a causal agent in the unfolding of that history"-- [*] "This book examines the extraterritorial application of UK public law.

It details the history of the civil and commercial code and provides readers with valuable information about the main principles that regulate relations between private individuals. Written in a clear and easy-to-understand style, it first presents the general principles of law and then addresses more specific aspects. It not only defines private law, but also explores how it works, and why it works the way it does. Topics covered include general rules of law, the law of obligations and contracts, the management of affairs without mandate and unjustified benefits, the law of property, family law and the law of inheritance.

Many such claims involve intellectual property infringement, but the treatment extends beyond that field of law. Because there are few formal international standards which govern the question of secondary liability, comprehension of the international landscape requires treatment of a broad range of national approaches. This book thus canvasses numerous jurisdictions across several continents, but presents these comparative studies thematically to highlight evolving commonalities and trans-border commercial practices that exist despite the lack of hard international law. The analysis presented in this book allows exploration not only of contemporary debates about the appropriate policy levers through which to regulate intermediaries, but also about the conceptual character of secondary liability rules.
